    "There are a relatively small number of actions that are taken over the course of a game. Therefore, it is reasonable to derive a strategy, if not for the whole game play-by-play, then by organizing a handful of turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "One overall strategy in the game is to minimize the number of times the sail action is used. This implies more turns are spent taking two *productive* actions that naturally synergize. For example, using the merchant guild means goods can be sold to acquire money to buy more goods on the same turn. Furthermore, this means sail actions will maximize moving both ships on the same turn, making the most of the movement available bewteen both ships.\n",

    "The hex grid will be stored in a dictionary using 3 coordinates to define the location. 3-dimensional coordintes will be translated into a 2D plan in order to create the grid. The projection of the 3D coordinates in a hex grid *plane* will require a transformation. The plane can be determined by any two vectors defined with. The two vectors that determine the plane are easily created by using any two pairs of hexgrids as oo"

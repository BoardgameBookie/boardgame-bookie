# Inquisition
The Light of Truth should be used when an event card instructs you or during an inquisition.

When you make an advisor active, you may interrogate them. If the advisor has no province's enmity, gain one glory for the inquisition. Then place one of your enmity stickers on the advisor. Secretly shine the light of truth on that advisor. If the advisor is a society member, you will see their rank as a number *(a higher number means higher rank)*. Do not reveal the number but read the corresponding entry in the Captain's Booke, then continue your turn. All players may write down what they hear. Enmity on an advisor increases the cost to hire that advisor by one gold for that player per enmity.

# Game 9

## Playbook

The colony phase of the game has been nothing short of disastrous when one considers my fall in the rankings from 2nd to 5th (last) and when looking back on my ambitions for the last few rounds. Joe's attack on my ship still feels like the most significant event in my SeaFall history. In the PvP set of rules within this game, sinking a ship full of goods is arguably the most impactful. All the gold and turns that goes down with the ship is impossible to replace.

As I am still trying to recover, my goals are modest since I don't have a clear path to any milestones. I will attempt to build another colony. I favor the enmity colony for Candyland, which has the best mines to raid in the whole game.

After my 2nd colony is founded I will attempt to reach the 5 buildings milestone. I don't think it will happen for me this game, but if the game does go long, then maybe there will be an opportunity.

If it is clear the 5 buildings milestone is not realistic, then I will attempt to raid a tomb again.

I'm keeping it simple. I don't think new paths to Glory will present themselves until Mike uses his map!

## Play-by-play

This was something of a rebound round for me, but my successes pale in comparison to the feats that Mike pulled off. Mike had been more successful than I during games 7 and 8 when we were both trying to build colonies. I've chalked up my shortcomings mostly to bad luck, but some might say I have a persecution complex. Going into Game 9 Mike had 2 colonies and Dave and I had 1. Mike also had the best build advisor in the game that gives him an extra good to start and a mega build cost reduction. In brief, Mike was able to leverage this advantage into a 3rd colony by turn 3, earning him a milestone, and then build 5 structures by turn 8, which ended the game. When the dust settled Mike earned a ridiculous 25 glory, or 3 glory a turn. I managed to snag second place with 12 points.

My game started great. I picked up the Noble on turn 1, which gave me buy +5. Since my colony already gave me a good and I started with a treasure of gold for being last, I was able to build a colony on my second turn! I chose to build the Sail +3 colony on the 4th island. Only a sail 5 boat can reach the island on the first turn, so I've upgraded both of my boats to maximum sail of 5. Now I'll be able to reach the other side of the board on the second action of my second turn.

However, this victory meant I had no resources left. I set about to build 5 structures, but the math didn't work out in my favor. I couldn't collect the gold to buy the goods to build the structures. I lost turn when I miscounted my gold and ended up 1 gold short of where I planned to be; I had to raid a mine instead. Regardless, even if I had planned ahead and every move was maximally efficient I still could not have stopped Mike. Mike had a structure on turn 1. He built a colony on turn 4 and then another structure on turn 6. However, the kicker is that he top decked the second most powerful builder in the game and the one that allows you to build twice on the same turn. This sealed it for him. Mike was able his two powerful builders each winter. Mike's victory was a confluence of great in game advisor luck and all the effort and planning it took to build all those colonies.

All that said, Mike is trying to run the table on our group. We can't progress to the final box without Mike, because he has the map fragment that unlocks the box. Mike feigned that he didn't have an explorer advisor good enough to discover the next island, but he had a Guild Hall and could easily had focused his resources on acquiring one of the game breaking explorer advisors. Instead, Mike realized he could beat everyone to the colony and structure milestones and nobody could do anything about it. However, now that Mike has winning velocity, Dave and I agreed to work together to slow him down.

In retrospect, I probably spent too much of my resources on acquiring raid advisors. I had kept Randy and picked up Cherry Bomb and the Soldier's Patron. I did this half because I didn't want them to be used against me. Then again, I never used them to great effect myself. On the final turn, the final tomb was revealed, but I couldn't reach it in time to attempt a raid. I had a 20 minute discussion with the table about attacking Mike's province in an attempt to prevent him from gaining the 5 structures milestone, but to my chagrin I couldn't do anything useful. I could have taken his build x2 advisor, but I'd lose a turn doing so and he'd still beat me to 5 structures. Had I not made my math error and lost a turn, I would have been able to swing it my way, but c'est la vie.

None the less, I was happy with a second place finish, but know I can do better next time.

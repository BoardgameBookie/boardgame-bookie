# Game 9

## Playbook

The colony phase of the game has been nothing short of disastrous when one considers my fall in the rankings from 2nd to 5th (last) and when looking back on my ambitions for the last few rounds. Joe's attack on my ship still feels like the most significant event in my SeaFall history. In the PvP set of rules within this game, sinking a ship full of goods is arguably the most impactful. All the gold and turns that goes down with the ship is impossible to replace.

As I am still trying to recover, my goals are modest since I don't have a clear path to any milestones. I will attempt to build another colony. I favor the enmity colony for Candyland, which has the best mines to raid in the whole game.

After my 2nd colony is founded I will attempt to reach the 5 buildings milestone. I don't think it will happen for me this game, but if the game does go long, then maybe there will be an opportunity.

If it is clear the 5 buildings milestone is not realistic, then I will attempt to raid a tomb again.

I'm keeping it simple. I don't think new paths to Glory will present themselves until Mike uses his map!

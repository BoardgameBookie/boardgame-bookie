# Game 11
## Playbook

My plan for this game is fairly straightforward.

1. Raid the tomb again. I've got Randy from last game to do it.

1. Collect as many research cards as possible. The new game mechanic is a treasure hunt! There are 5 treasures. I'd love to discover at least one of them.

1. Slow down Mike somehow. I need to steal an advisor, use the Master Thief, or steal the Sword relic from his ships. If he ever separates his ships I'll need to strike immediately, so my game plan cannot take place over too many turns;

1. Try to make my strategy modular (2 or 3 turns each module) and therefore more flexible.

### Key Advisors
* The Historian: When you research, keep 1 extra card.
* The Treasure Hunter: You may keep all the cards you draw when you research.
* The Master Thief
* The Bosun: At the end of your turn, before exhausting the Bosun, refresh any advisor in your council room.
* The Cannoneer
* The Patriot
* The Pirate
* The Clerk
* The Contractor
* The Blackmailer
* The Politician

There could be a potentially awesome combo with research cards by using The Bosun along with The Historian or The Treasure Hunter.

  * If you find the Treasure Hunter, hire them and repeat Turn 2.
* Sail to Mike's port.
* Raid Mike's Council Room and steal the cool advisor.
  * Mike could potentially negate 7 dice from my raid pool (3 garrison, 2 of my permanent enmity, 2 from Mike's ships in port).
  * I need to have at least 12 raid to consider this (79% chance of 3 successes from dice pool of 5).
    * base raid is 7 (5 Adamantium + 1 from support ship + 1 from Mike's enmity token)
    * without any raid advisor I could spend all my reputation (5) to boost Nefarious bonus to +5 raid.
  * Without an advisor power, if I succeed I lose Mike's enmity token and give him 2 of my enmity tokens.
    * The Patriot, The Pirate, The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel

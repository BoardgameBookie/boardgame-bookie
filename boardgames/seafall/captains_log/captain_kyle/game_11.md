# Game 11
## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Raid the tomb again. I've got Randy from last game to do it.

1. Collect as many research cards as possible. The new game mechanic is a treasure hunt! There are 5 treasures. I'd love to discover at least one of them.

1. Slow down Mike somehow. I need to steal an advisor, use the Master Thief, or steal the Sword relic from his ships. If he ever separates his ships I'll need to strike immediately, so my game plan cannot take place over too many turns;

1. Try to make my strategy modular (2 or 3 turns each module) and therefore more flexible.

### Key Advisors
* The Bosun: At the end of your turn, before exhausting the Bosun, refresh any advisor in your council room.
* The Historian: When you research, keep 1 extra card.
* The Treasure Hunter: You may keep all the cards you draw when you research.

There is an awesome combo to collect research cards by using The Bosun along with The Historian or The Treasure Hunter.

# Game 11
## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Raid the tomb again. I've got Randy from last game to do it.

1. Collect as many research cards as possible. The new game mechanic is a treasure hunt! There are 5 treasures. I'd love to discover at least one of them.

1. Slow down Mike somehow. I need to steal an advisor, use the Master Thief, or steal the Sword relic from his ships. If he ever separates his ships I'll need to strike immediately, so my game plan cannot take place over too many turns;

1. Try to make my strategy modular (2 or 3 turns each module) and therefore more flexible.

### Key Advisors
* The Bosun: At the end of your turn, before exhausting the Bosun, refresh any advisor in your council room.
* The Historian: When you research, keep 1 extra card.
* The Treasure Hunter: You may keep all the cards you draw when you research.

There is an awesome combo to collect research cards by using The Bosun along with The Historian or The Treasure Hunter.

## Play-by-play
This was one of the shortest games we've played based solely on the number of turns, 6, but it took a while, because we got to open a box. In terms of glory I did not have a good game, but in terms of executing my strategy I did well; there was room for improvement but I was satisfied. I managed to get a good bundle of charts including 2 complete sets! I was one space away (and ultimately one turn away) from cashing in, so this will end up being my first order of business in game 12.

Scott ended up winning big, because he hit upon an interesting strategy by raiding a poorly defended dock twice. He was able to do it twice in a single year, because he has a tablet that removes enmity tokens. He also got a whopping 9 glory for discovering the second to last island. Furthermore, the game got sped up when the interrogation mechanic was introduced. Everyone got a slow trickle of glory by interrogating an advisor each turn. This play mechanic was big surprise! There is a little black light LED that reveals clues that were hidden in plain sight the whole time! All in all it was another great game for Scott.

With regards to the clues, we learned that the clerk is a private member of The Society (she showed us the tomb map has more secrets), but she was the only one out of the dozen or so we pursued. We also learned that the trinity of The Worn, The Ancient, and The Cryptic are key to something from the Bringer of Storms.

I was finally able to execute my plans without them falling apart during the first couple turns. I was able to get the Bosun on turn 1. I hit a snag at the end of turn one when the event caused a pirate to raid my vault and take half my gold (3 coins), which I spent down to 6 during a build and upgrade phase. On the second turn I headed straight to Mike's port and stole the Treasure Hunter. It was awesome. I spent my last 3 coins using the Guild Hall to find a raid advisor and stumble into the Soldier's Patron. I desperately wanted Mike's advisor, so I used the Patrons ability to dismiss an advisor, Randy, and added 7 additional dice to my pool. I managed to scare Mike off from using his tablet and warping his ships home. He wanted to retaliate, but then the box got opened and he got distracted. I had to return an enmity to him and give him 2 of mine. Thankfully, at the end of the game I was able to claim them back with a good roll on 1 reputation and 2 fortune.

I had to tax to get coins to research, for my last three turns I pulled off the intensive research part of my plan using the Treasure Hunter twice along with the Bosun. I'm glad I did not delay, because I was caught off guard when we didn't even get to play the second winter.

Mike and Dave both bought structures that make great use of their acquired treasures. Dave has 3 relics and Mike has 3 tablets and these structures equate to 7 glory, which more or less represents the differences in our scores for this game. The rest of us need to steal a relic or tablet to remove this advantage and thankfully the new advisors have some incredible powers to help make this happen. Mike's score is particularly impressive considering that I stole an advisor from him and Dave used the Master Thief to steal 5 gold from him; even with all this he finished well ahead of me! Hopefully, by cashing in on my charts I can make up some ground. I'm pretty far behind in the standings, I keep losing ground to the leader, and it feels like the end is right around the corner. We'll see whether or not I can mount a comeback, but I'm having so much fun with this game. I love the new puzzle element where we are gathering clues from interrogating our advisors; it is such a fun twist!

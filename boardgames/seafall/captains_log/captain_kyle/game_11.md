# Game 11
## Playbook

My plan for this game is fairly straightforward.

1. Raid the tomb again. I've got Randy from last game to do it.

1. Collect as many research cards as possible. The new game mechanic is a treasure hunt! There are 5 treasures. I'd love to discover at least one of them.

1. Slow down Mike somehow. I need to steal an advisor, use the Master Thief, or steal the Sword relic from his ships. If he ever separates his ships I'll need to strike immediately, so my game plan cannot take place over too many turns; it needs to be modular with the modules being no longer than 2 turns.

### Key Advisors
* The Historian
* The Treasure Hunter
* The Master Thief
* The Bosun
* The Cannoneer
* The Patriot
* The Pirate
* The Clerk
* The Contractor
* The Blackmailer
* The Politician

There could be a potentially awesome combo with research cards by using The Bosun along with The Historian or The Treasure Hunter.

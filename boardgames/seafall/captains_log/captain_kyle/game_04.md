# Game 4

## Playbook

My goal was to win the ship-raid milestone. I needed to sink a ship. I had tried to do this in the previous game, but did not realize that a large dice pool is needed to sink a ship. Therefore, my strategy this game was to acquire ship upgrades that improved my raid and also acquire advisors with raid bonuses.

My first turn would be spent outfitting my ships and I was fortunate to acquire Bran the builder who had been upgraded to have significant discounts for upgrades and building. I would add the Swift upgrade to my gun boat so that it could sail farther and catch the other players' ships, which conveniently all had a sail of 3. Everyone has favored keeping their ships paired and upgrading explorer. I've tried to zag where others have zigged and have taken an asymmetric approach where each of my ships is specialized.

There are two iron ship wrights on the first two islands that I could attack to acquire 2 glory: one for a successful endeavor and another for acquiring an upgrade. However, the second island was my only option, because of a permanent enmity on the first island made the dock too difficult to raid. I would then raid a good or mine on my way to a spice dock to acquire another 2 glory.

During my tour of the islands I would be on the lookout for a ship to sink.

## Play-by-play

My first turn yielded 3 glory and I got the +1 to sail I needed to reach the second island. My second turn also went as planned and I acquired the deadly upgrade and my base raid reached 5. I was also fortunate to pick up the advisor named Randy who gave a +4 to raid, so when I ran across a susceptible ship I'd be ready.

I went to the dangerous island to raid the spice dock and succeeded there, but took significant damage. I lost all my upgrades and took a damage and a curse. The curse was punishing, because I could not remove it since no one had discovered an ancient statue. It also prevented me from repairing my ship at my home port. This became an urgent situation I had to resolve.

Fortunately, I was near the island with the 6 gold repair, but I had no gold having spent it all on the first turn, so I had to raid the closest mine. I used Randy for the mine raid with my fast ship (I couldn't risk sinking the other), but I took a curse that meant I couldn't keep both ships together anymore.

At this point in the game I had built up sizeable lead since I was collecting 1 or 2 glory every turn after starting with 3. However, I started losing ground to large windfalls from everyone else exploring islands and tombs. I looked adrift with my ships so damaged and battle-worn and had to spend a couple turns moving and repairing and removing the curse from my fast ship. On one turn all I did was move and buy research cards.

Finally, winter came and refreshed Randy as an advisor. I spent all game waiting for a poor soul to sail too close to my boats, but the opportunity had not yet presented itself... until one did. Joe took some damage on a fateful exploration and was making a beeline for his home port and his path just so happened to cross mine. I did not delay and went after him with my full force and sunk his ship. I claimed the milestone and triggered the end game.

Remarkably, Dave explored a tomb on his final turn, acquired 5 glory, and ended up in a tie with me. However, I won the tie breaker due to the fact that I started the game in last place. It was a notable reversal of fortune for almost everyone from game 3. Mike and Joe somehow only managed 2 glory a piece each having lost ships that had been upgraded.

For my victor's reward I took the appellation that allows me to use all three actions of the merchants guild in a single turn. My long game is to leave the pirate's life and become a merchant. Overall, I stuck to my game plan and it ended up more or less going as planned. I think there is a real benefit to mapping out the first few turns at least. I thought I would sink a ship sooner, but the damage I sustained delayed this endeavor. In particular, the curse that prevented me from returning to home port was brutal, because I had built a port anticipating taking on damage but never got to use it.

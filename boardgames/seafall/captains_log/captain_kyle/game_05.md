# Game 5

## Playbook

There were only two milestones remaining. One required owning 2 relics was not realistic for me seeing as how I had little explore and Dave already had a relic. The other milestone required selling 4 of the same type of good. Having won the last round I ended up without a starting advisor and the merchant's guild advisors with +2 were rather rare; there were only 2 in the advisor deck. Therefore, it is prudent to explore the tombs since they have large payouts.

To help explore the tombs I'd need help from an advisor and Dave has one that gives +8! Since Dave was the overall leader now I could steal it from him in a raid without having to worry about starting game enmity. I could spend two turns upgrading my raid ship with the deadly upgrade after making a first round purchase. My raid ship was slow with a sail of 2, so it is a good game to attack another player's home port. The best part is I know Dave will be making a beeline for the tombs, so he won't be around to retaliate.

After getting a good advisor I would head to the tombs myself, armed with a couple research cards to boot. If the tombs aren't an option at this point I will sail into uncharted waters and try my hand at discovering a new island.

Finally, I'll keep an eye out for an advisor that has the sell +2 necessary for the trade flourishes milestone.

## Play-by-play

This was a funny game, because I had planned on attacking Dave from the start, but Joe happened to already have 1 of the 2 advisors with sell +2. I had forgotten that he kept him from the previous game and upgraded the advisor with a retired trader sticker. I followed through on my first two turns to upgrade my raid ship with deadly. Joe immediately went about acquiring the 4 goods he needed in the first two turns, but wasn't able to sell them until his 4th turn. This was my window of opportunity.

On my third turn I sailed into Joe's port. I had recruited two advisors with raid and one had to ability to play multiple advisors. I went all in, guns blazing, then made it out with Joe's advisor and without taking any damage. I felt rather proud of myself, but knew I couldn't show anything other than some form of guilt or remorse, because Joe was livid. I essentially ended his game early and completely took him by surprise.

For my efforts Joe made promises to me that I would regret my actions, that I had made a mistake, and that he would retaliate with disproportionate force to deter me and others from attacking Joe in the future. Unfortunately for him he had invested so much in explore that he didn't have the guns to fight back, even with the 3 enmity I had given him. When Joe realized this he said his revenge would come in a future game. He couldn't promise when, but he said he would not forget my transgression. I do not doubt him.

I had to laugh, because the same thing happened between Jeremy and I in Risk Legacy. I single-handedly prevented Jeremy from winning one round and I drew his ire much the same way I drew Joe's. Jeremy and Joe both made declarations their strategy would consist of preventing my success. In Risk Legacy, Jeremy could follow through, because of the kamikaze nature of the attacking rules. We'll see what happens in SeaFall, because enmity really keeps things in check. The scales really tilt if you are the aggressor. I was able to get away with it this game, because I've so far been the only one to invest in raid.

After the raid I went about securing goods, so that I could accomplish the milestone. Having made two purchases and an upgrade I did not have money to buy goods, so I did two additional raids for goods. Finally, winter came and with the cash influx I was able to use my appellation on the first turn to reach the milestone. The game ended shortly thereafter by Dave. Dave had a great game: he acquired another relic and reached the miletone gaining 8 glory in a single turn. Then he found a pile of gold in another tomb exploration and bought a structure that gave him 2 glory for every relic.

Dave was acquiring glory so fast I was worried I wouldn't be able to make my sale, but I managed to do so on the penultimate turn. I got a field upgrade for my troubles.

I also learned about two tombs that use raid endeavors instead of exploration. I took note and these are the Sarcophagus Room and the Chasm of Echos. The two attempts at these led to sunken ships! Perhaps I can capitalize with my raid ship. I upgraded its speed to 3, so that it can actually travel to the tombs.

The new colony rules really emphasize the merchants guild, so maybe now I can leave the pirate life behind.

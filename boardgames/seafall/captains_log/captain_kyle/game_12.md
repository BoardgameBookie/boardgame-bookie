# Game 12
## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Get to the temple and raid it ASAP. This is worth 5 glory and there is a chance that I can hire Society advisors there.

1. Investigate the charts (and hope nobody raids your province first).

1. Keep up with the modular strategy (2 or 3 turns each module) and stay flexible.

### Key Advisors
* The Keeper of Lore: When Keeper of Lore becomes your active advisor, draw the top four cards of the Research deck and keep two.
* The Ninth Initiate (or others that shine the light of truth on the forum): When the Ninth Initiate becomes your active advisor, shine the light of truth on advisors in the forum. You must hire all private society members for free. You may take a card from any treasure room that doesn't have enmity on it. Place four enmity on that treasure room. This is not a raid or endeavor.
* The Seeker of Answers: When Seeker of Answers becomes your active advisor, you must take an advisor from a province's council room (if it doesn't have enmity on it). Place two enmity tokens on that council room. You may use as many goods as you want to discount a build action this turn.

### SeaFall Master Plan

#### First Winter
* I am 21 points behind the leader, so I get 5 bonuses.
   * Add 2 reputation bonuses and 3 gold bonuses
* Starting gold is 12g (home province) + 3g (rubble) + 9g (title bonus)
* Activate Kites for -6g
* iron from (kites) and 3g (rubble)
* Place relic on Amazon Prime Now.
* **21 gold, 3 glory**

#### Turn 1
* Pay the gold price for an advisor, unless the advisor has a raid bonus of 2 more than the reputation cost.
* **Advisor Watchlist** (67% chance of appearing on the winter flop)
   1. The Arsonist
   1. The Advanced Scout
   1. The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel
   1. The Cannoneer
   1. The Grizzled Veteran
   1. The Master of Munitions
   1. The Master Thief
   1. The Patriot
   1. The Pirate
   1. The Renowned Soldier
   1. The Savage
   1. The Soldier's Patron
   1. The Tinker
   1. The Wind Master
* **Secondary Advisor Watchlist** (if none of the above are available... >73% chance of finding primary or secondary advisor on the winter flop)
   1. The Blackmailer
   1. The Builder's Patron
   1. The Contractor
   1. The Foreman
   1. The Politician

* Upgrade Adamantium with Nefarious -10g
* Sail to Kites
* **11 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* **Advisor Watchlist**
   1. If a desired advisor was not acquired in turn 1, there is a 90% chance a primary advisor will appear in turn 2 (assuming everyone claims an advisor in turn 1 and no one else is looking for a raid advisor).
* Sail to Arados
* Raid the temple. The temple is a site at the colony, so we raid against the colony defenses, a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10.
  * Success is guaranteed even if we receive 2 damage, so 8 successes is the threshold to clear.
     * If we are willing to exhaust the Nefarious upgrade then the threshold is 7 successes.
  * Adamantium has base raid of 5. Amazon will add support of 1 (dice pool of 6).
  * We lose two dice to the garrison (6 - 2 = dice pool of 4).
  * If we fail to find a raid advisor, pump Nefarious with 7 reputation (4 + 7 = dice pool of 11. ~71% chance of success).
     * Rolling with anything less than a dice pool of 11 is unadvised. Rolling with 13 would be the sweet-spot in terms of diminishing returns on success.
     * dice pool of 10 is ~58% chance of success
     * dice pool of 11 is ~71% chance of success
     * dice pool of 12 is ~81% chance of success
     * **dice pool of 13 is ~89% chance of success**
     * dice pool of 14 is ~93% chance of success

* **11 gold, 10 glory**

#### Turn 3
* Sail to Japan.
* Raid the spice dock.
   * Raid of 6 (5 + support ship) - 2 dice for island garrison. Dice pool of 4 against 4 defense.
   * dice pool of 4 has ~20% chance no damage and ~60% chance 1 damage or less.
* **11 gold, 12 glory**

#### Turn 4
* Sail to Hangry
* Raid the wood dock.
   * Raid of 6 (5 + support ship) - 3 dice for island garrison. Dice pool of 3 against 4 defense.
   * If I have any leftover reputation, charge up Nefarious with 1 reputation.
   * dice pool of 3 has ~30% chance of 1 damage and ~75% chance 2 damage or less.
* **11 gold, 14 glory**

#### Turn 5
* Sail Adamantium to Crappy and Amazon Prime Now to the Eastern Most Atoll.
* Build a garrison with iron in Kites.
   * If I spent 8 gold to purchase an Arados or Patmos advisor, then I'll need a build bonus. Reserve 3 gold for research in Turn 6.
**9 gold, 15 glory**

#### Turn 6
* Research with the Treasure Hunter
* Explore the iron market with the charts
**6 gold, 15 glory**

#### Second winter

**23 gold, 16 glory**

#### Turn 7
* Buy a treasure
* Research with the Treasure Hunter
* Explore the atoll with the charts

## Play-by-play
This game was by far my best game. I won by a significant margin and managed to get some significant upgrades along the way. My game planning has paid off the last two games, so I'm convinced a more modular strategy is the best approach. This game lasted past the winter, but only by another round. A lot of milestones were met and there was some really interesting play with the Arados advisors.

This game was a thrill from start to finish. Discussion around the table centered around sacking the Temple in Arados, but no one was going to reach it before I did. My gambit with the Nefarious upgrade paid off since I was not able to procure a raid advisor by my second turn. I spent all 7 of my reputation and rolled 11 dice against a 10 defense. Luckily, I had 9 successes (23.4% chance of 9 or more with a pool of 11. My luck would change when I later raided the dock in Japan. I rolled a 4 against 4 and ended up with 0, a 20% chance. I had to use my two fortune.). It felt great to grab a 5 glory milestone. It felt even better when I received 20 gold for my trouble after sacking a building worth 40! I did not realize this would happen when I made my plans.

With my bounty I was able to buy an expensive Arados advisor that allowed my to steal an advisor. Naturally I targeted Mike and stole Bob Villa, who is one of the most powerful advisors in the game. Funny enough, I had left my game 11 plans after the last game and they fell into Mike's hands. Mike, Dave, and Scott read them and, to my chagrin, Mike stumbled across my stated objective to slow him down! Needless to say after I stole his advisor the gloves came off. Mike raided me on his next turn and stole the advisor that steals other advisors! I lost a glory to boot. Then later in the game Mike got the Arados advisor that lets him steal a treasure and he stole one of the rare charts with the sword
that led to a treasure. It was a brilliant play by Mike, because on the same turn he was able to discover that treasure and claim the Super Explorer ship upgrade. The advisors that steal treasure or other advisors are extremely powerful (and make people angry).

Fortunately, despite the war between Mike and I, I was still able to chase down the treasures I had from my maps. The rewards were amazing! I got the fabulous Super Raid ship upgrade on Adamantium and the Super Hold upgrade on Amazon Prime Now. I was able to do this and collect 6 more research cards for my trouble. Unfortunately, none of the 6 research cards were very interesting. Since every location on every island has been explored, I'm not sure when the land explore bonus charts will come in handy again.

Despite playing my best game, I'm still significantly behind Mike and Scott who are both setting the pace in the overall score. It would take a second win just as impressive as this one to help the close the gap, but I don't have as clear a path towards more glory as I did this game. Never the less, I'll savor this one. I ended up with a number of fun upgrades. My leader's reputation is now a 6! I'm one away from capping out at the max of 7. The reputation has been a big part of my game as the advisors have played a larger role as the game has gone along. I regret not taking the taxes +1 leader upgrade when I sunk Joe's ship a while back, I took a reputation upgrade at the time, because if I cap out my reputation I might not be able to maximize a milestone bonus in the future; the taxes +1 upgrade is pretty unique to boot, though I've played all of my reputation tokens almost every game, so it was likely the right call when all is said and done. I also got two incredible ship upgrades and Adamantium now has a raid of 7! That is incredible! I'll have to use this new found firepower to my advantage. I'm not sure how I'll capitalize on my hold upgrade, but at least that ship will be hard to sink.

I agonized over my victory province upgrade, but Joe helped me make my decision. It came down to considering upgrading a field from 6 to 8 or taking a new appellation. While gold is versatile, I ended up taking The Wise appellation that allows me to obtain an additional advisor during my turn. I love this appellation, because the advisors, I believe, have been the most important part of the game. When I began the game, after reading the rules, I thought to play SeaFall as an engine building game. I wanted to become a great merchant and develop such a fool proof approach to buying and selling goods that I'd be able to amass glory through shear industry and play parallel to the exploration of the islands and sea. However, I only came to realize this was not a viable strategy only after I obtained The Prosperous appellation through my only other game victory. To consider replacing this appellation felt like I was throwing away that earlier game victory. I didn't want it to feel like a waste, but when I realized that it had been several games since I had even thought about The Prosperous appellation, let alone use it. The Prosperous appellation did come in handy once or twice during the colony phase of the game, but it was never game changing even when I did use. I think The Wise has tremendous upside. Even though I can only activate one advisor a turn, I'll now be able to hate-draft. If I top-deck a great advisor after obtaining an advisor I'll be able to grab it! That would have come in handy the one game Joe sunk me after top-decking Randy. Time will tell if this was the right decision, but I can already imagine having some fun with this ability.

As an aside, there was an interesting race to build the Temple structure that got refreshed after the second winter. Joe had been playing possum collecting coin and actively avoiding glory in order to become first player on the first turn after the second winter, so that he would have the first crack at building The Temple. Unfortunately, a bit of a shame, Dave caught on the Joe's strategy, because the same idea occurred to him. Dave almost realized this too late, except, when it dawned on him he would lose his turn order, he realized that he had accidentally taken a glory for interrogating an advisor that had already been interrogated. This led to a very awkward situation where Dave benefited from an earlier mistake; he ultimately did build The Temple before Joe. Joe was a good sport about it, but he did express his frustration to me. He absolutely would have been able to adjust his strategy had Dave counted his glory correctly in the first place. Alas, clerical errors are just part of board gaming to some degree.

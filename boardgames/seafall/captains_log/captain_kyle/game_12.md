# Game 12
## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Get to the temple and raid it ASAP. This is worth 5 glory and there is a chance that I can hire Society advisors there.

1. Investigate the charts (and hope nobody raids your province first).

1. Keep up with the modular strategy (2 or 3 turns each module) and stay flexible.

### Key Advisors
* The Keeper of Lore: When Keeper of Lore becomes your active advisor, draw the top four cards of the Research deck and keep two.
* The Ninth Initiate (or others that shine the light of truth on the forum): When the Ninth Initiate becomes your active advisor, shine the light of truth on advisors in the forum. You must hire all private society members for free. You may take a card from any treasure room that doesn't have enmity on it. Place four enmity on that treasure room. This is not a raid or endeavor.
* The Seeker of Answers: When Seeker of Answers becomes your active advisor, you must take an advisor from a province's council room (if it doesn't have enmity on it). Place two enmity tokens on that council room. You may use as many goods as you want to discount a build action this turn.

### SeaFall Master Plan

#### First Winter
* I am 21 points behind the leader, so I get 5 bonuses.
   * Add 2 reputation bonuses and 3 gold bonuses
* Starting gold is 12g (home province) + 3g (rubble) + 9g (title bonus)
* Activate Kites for -6g
* iron from (kites) and 3g (rubble)
* Place relic on Amazon Prime Now.
* **21 gold, 3 glory**

#### Turn 1
* Pay the gold price for an advisor, unless the advisor has a raid bonus of 2 more than the reputation cost.
* **Advisor Watchlist** (67% chance of appearing on the winter flop)
   1. The Arsonist
   1. The Advanced Scout
   1. The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel
   1. The Cannoneer
   1. The Grizzled Veteran
   1. The Master of Munitions
   1. The Master Thief
   1. The Patriot
   1. The Pirate
   1. The Renowned Soldier
   1. The Savage
   1. The Soldier's Patron
   1. The Tinker
   1. The Wind Master
* **Secondary Advisor Watchlist** (if none of the above are available... >73% chance of finding primary or secondary advisor on the winter flop)
   1. The Blackmailer
   1. The Builder's Patron
   1. The Contractor
   1. The Foreman
   1. The Politician

* Upgrade Adamantium with Nefarious -10g
* Sail to Kites
* **11 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* **Advisor Watchlist**
   1. If a desired advisor was not acquired in turn 1, there is a 90% chance a primary advisor will appear in turn 2 (assuming everyone claims an advisor in turn 1 and no one else is looking for a raid advisor).
* Sail to Arados
* Raid the temple. The temple is a site at the colony, so we raid against the colony defenses, a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10.
  * Success is guaranteed even if we receive 2 damage, so 8 successes is the threshold to clear.
     * If we are willing to exhaust the Nefarious upgrade then the threshold is 7 successes.
  * Adamantium has base raid of 5. Amazon will add support of 1 (dice pool of 6).
  * We lose two dice to the garrison (6 - 2 = dice pool of 4).
  * If we fail to find a raid advisor, pump Nefarious with 7 reputation (4 + 7 = dice pool of 11. ~71% chance of success).
     * Rolling with anything less than a dice pool of 11 is unadvised. Rolling with 13 would be the sweet-spot in terms of diminishing returns on success.
     * dice pool of 10 is ~58% chance of success
     * dice pool of 11 is ~71% chance of success
     * dice pool of 12 is ~81% chance of success
     * **dice pool of 13 is ~89% chance of success**
     * dice pool of 14 is ~93% chance of success

* **11 gold, 10 glory**

#### Turn 3
* Sail to Japan.
* Raid the spice dock.
   * Raid of 6 (5 + support ship) - 2 dice for island garrison. Dice pool of 4 against 4 defense.
   * dice pool of 4 has ~20% chance no damage and ~60% chance 1 damage or less.
* **11 gold, 12 glory**

#### Turn 4
* Sail to Hangry
* Raid the wood dock.
   * Raid of 6 (5 + support ship) - 3 dice for island garrison. Dice pool of 3 against 4 defense.
   * If I have any leftover reputation, charge up Nefarious with 1 reputation.
   * dice pool of 3 has ~30% chance of 1 damage and ~75% chance 2 damage or less.
* **11 gold, 14 glory**

#### Turn 5
* Sail Adamantium to Crappy and Amazon Prime Now to the Eastern Most Atoll.
* Build a garrison with iron in Kites.
   * If I spent 8 gold to purchase an Arados or Patmos advisor, then I'll need a build bonus. Reserve 3 gold for research in Turn 6.
**9 gold, 15 glory**

#### Turn 6
* Research with the Treasure Hunter
* Explore the iron market with the charts
**6 gold, 15 glory**

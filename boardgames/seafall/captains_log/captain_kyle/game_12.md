# Game 12
## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Get to the temple and raid it ASAP. This is worth 5 glory and I can hire Society advisors there.

1. Investigate the charts (and hope nobody raids your province first).

1. Keep up with the modular strategy (2 or 3 turns each module) and stay flexible.

### Key Advisors
* The Keeper of Lore: When Keeper of Lore becomes your active advisor, draw the top four cards of the Research deck and keep two.
* The Ninth Initiate (or others that shine the light of truth on the forum): When the Ninth Initiate becomes your active advisor, shine the light of truth on advisors in the forum. You must hire all private society members for free. You may take a card from any treasure room that doesn't have enmity on it. Place four enmity on that treasure room. This is not a raid or endeavor.
* The Seeker of Answers: When Seeker of Answers becomes your active advisor, you must take an advisor from a province's council room (if it doesn't have enmity on it). Place two enmity tokens on that council room. You may use as many goods as you want to discount a build action this turn.

### SeaFall opening (Phase I)

   1. The Advanced Scout
   1. The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel

* Upgrade Adamantium with Nefarious -10g
* Sail to Kites
* **11 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* **Advisor Watchlist**
   1. If a desired advisor was not acquired in turn 1, there is a 90% chance one will appear in turn 2.
* Sail to Arados
* Raid the temple. The temple is a site at the colony, so we raid against the colony defenses, a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10.
  * Success is guaranteed even if we receive 2 damage, so 8 successes is the threshold to clear.
     * If we are willing to exhaust the Nefarious upgrade then the threshold is 7 successes.
  * Adamantium has base raid of 5. Amazon will add support of 1 (dice pool of 6).
  * We lose two dice to the garrison (6 - 2 = dice pool of 4).
  * If we fail to find a raid advisor, pump Nefarious with 7 reputation (4 + 7 = dice pool of 11. ~71% chance of success).
     * Rolling with anything less than a dice pool of 11 is unadvised. Rolling with 13 would be the sweet-spot in terms of diminishing returns on success.
     * dice pool of 10 is ~58% chance of success
     * dice pool of 11 is ~71% chance of success
     * dice pool of 12 is ~81% chance of success
     * **dice pool of 13 is ~89% chance of success**
     * dice pool of 14 is ~93% chance of success

* **11 gold, 10 glory**

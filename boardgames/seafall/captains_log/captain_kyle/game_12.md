# Game 12
## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Get to the temple and raid it ASAP. This is worth 5 glory and I can hire Society advisors there. 10 defense on the temple. Colony has a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10.

1. Investigate the charts (and hope nobody raids your province first).

1. Keep up with the modular strategy (2 or 3 turns each module) and stay flexible.

### Key Advisors
* The Keeper of Lore: When Keeper of Lore becomes your active advisor, draw the top four cards of the Research deck and keep two.
* The Ninth Initiate (or others that shine the light of truth on the forum): When the Ninth Initiate becomes your active advisor, shine the light of truth on advisors in the forum. You must hire all private society members for free. You may take a card from any treasure room that doesn't have enmity on it. Place four enmity on that treasure room. This is not a raid or endeavor.
* The Seeker of Answers: When Seeker of Answers becomes your active advisor, you must take an advisor from a province's council room (if it doesn't have enmity on it). Place two enmity tokens on that council room. You may use as many goods as you want to discount a build action this turn.

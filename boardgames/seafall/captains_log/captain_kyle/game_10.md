# Game 10
## Playbook

Kudos to Mike for game 9, but his decision to hold the game hostage with the map should not be let go without a response. Remarkably, Mike was able to acquire both the 3 colony and 5 structure milestones in the same game. Over games 7 and 8, Mike built up a large colony lead and also had the most powerful build advisor to start each game. Mike's careful planning paid off with the highest scoring round to date.

After the game Dave and I decided to ally with each other. Dave is going after Mike's map, which Mike originally stole from Dave. Dave will have to use the Guild Hall and The Pirate to steal the map back while avoiding a bucket of enmity. This is no small feat, and in retrospect Mike's original plunder of a map and tablet from Dave and Scott in the same game looks more and more impressive.

Meanwhile, I'll be looking for ways to stop Scott who managed to stay in first place by a single point. I've reserved The Cannoneer and I aim to sink Scott's ship after he has invested heavily into the Explorer ship upgrades before he reaches the last tomb. Scott is fond of ship upgrades. I'll also look for the Master Thief, which would be a powerful ally while I control Taxachussets.

In my own efforts to gain glory, I will raid the tomb myself if I can collect the right raid advisors. In addition, I'll try my hand at commerce once again with the aim to buy some large treasures. I'll activate my two colonies and build a guild hall on Tax+4 colony. Dave will also have to build a guild hall to prevent Mike from owning this powerful structure.

If the tomb raiding proves unsuccessful, I'll be opportunistic with trade. I'll look for advisors that give a bonus for selling a specific type of good. I'll keep my ships separated, except for raiding tombs.

We'll see how it all goes...

## Play-by-play

I did okay this round, but made a couple unforced errors that cost me the game. Then again I did luck into a very fortunate scenario on the last turn, so my unskilled play was balanced out a bit by this.

I went wrong during the planning before the game, because I mistook a wood dock for an iron dock on the island of Hangry. The iPhone photo I took must have been poorly illuminated. I did not realize my mistake until I moved my ships to Hangry expecting to upgrade my ship. I was confused and could not think of a savvy way fix my mistake, so I sailed back to my home port for the upgrade.

This was my most critical mistake. It cost me 2 turns worth of time and likely cost me the game. I was fixated on getting back on track with my game plan and failed to improvise. This wouldn't be the first time this has happened and I've concluded that the plans I am making are too rigid. I need to come into the game with a strategy, but not one that depends on a long chain of events. There is too much unpredictability, and I need a strategy that will let me exit into a contingency plan.

What I realized too late was that the Terrible upgrade for raid +1 was not really necessary to my ultimate goals. For instance, I was able to successfully raid a challenging tomb and the extra die I received from this upgrade would not have made the difference; my dice pool was already very strong. The correct move would have been to skip the upgrade and move to the next stage of my plan and accept the (slightly) greater risk when I raid. I've been too cautious with my rolling and I'm going to have to be bolder with my decision making if I am to catch up to Mike.

The second mistake I made was forgetting to buy a 10 gold treasure. I didn't realize until just after my turn. Our table is sometimes forgiving of these mistakes, but when I asked they firmly said it was too late. It turns out that 1 glory would have won me the game, because I ended 1 glory short of the leaders and a tie would have gone to me. I'll need to get in the habit of reading the turn order card to remind myself of the procedure like a pre-flight checklist. Even if I more or less have the order of events committed to memory, when my concentration is on an exciting endeavor I've overlooked important details.

The most amazingly grand stroke of luck happened on the last turn of the game. No one was able to successfully take the chart away from Mike and he was able to discover the island that opened the 4th box. Incredibly, the milestone from the box was to conquer the colony of the Pirate King who we had unwittingly enraged as we've plundered and exploited his people's islands throughout the first 10 games. Unfortunately for the Pirate King, I had my raid advisors queued up for a second raid on the tomb, but the new island was just within sailing distance of my ships. Instead of raiding the tombs I made a beeline for this colony and wrecked the Pirate King. His reign lasted less than half a turn. The prize for conquering the Pirate King is a colony, which is a rich reward. The best feature of the colony is that it is always active! There are new rules to steal colonies, so I'll need to take measures to protect it.

The craziest part of the whole game was that Joe unexpectedly won on an exploration of a moon space. He was thinking he'd just get grab a glory, but it he chose a great passage in the Captain's Booke, found a statue and 3 glory, which pushed into a tie with Mike. Joe won the tie breaker, because he had the lower title.

Finally, Dave had an interesting Merchant strategy. He collected a good number of merchant advisors and a structure that gave +4 gold to goods sold. He was raking in the cash, but did not realize Mike was capable of ending the game on turn 7. Unfortunately, he ended the game with a vault full of unspent gold.

# Game 10
## Playbook

Kudos to Mike for game 9, but his decision to hold the game hostage with the map should not be let go without a response. Remarkably, Mike was able to acquire both the 3 colony and 5 structure milestones in the same game. Over games 7 and 8, Mike built up a large colony lead and also had the most powerful build advisor to start each game. Mike's careful planning paid off with the highest scoring round to date.

After the game Dave and I decided to ally with each other. Dave is going after Mike's map, which Mike originally stole from Dave. Dave will have to use the Guild Hall and The Pirate to steal the map back while avoiding a bucket of enmity. This is no small feat, and in retrospect Mike's original plunder of a map and tablet from Dave and Scott in the same game looks more and more impressive.

Meanwhile, I'll be looking for ways to stop Scott who managed to stay in first place by a single point. I've reserved The Cannoneer and I aim to sink Scott's ship after he has invested heavily into the Explorer ship upgrades before he reaches the last tomb. Scott is fond of ship upgrades. I'll also look for the Master Thief, which would be a powerful ally while I control Taxachussets.

In my own efforts to gain glory, I will raid the tomb myself if I can collect the right raid advisors. In addition, I'll try my hand at commerce once again with the aim to buy some large treasures. I'll activate my two colonies and build a guild hall on Tax+4 colony. Dave will also have to build a guild hall to prevent Mike from owning this powerful structure.

If the tomb raiding proves unsuccessful, I'll be opportunistic with trade. I'll look for advisors that give a bonus for selling a specific type of good. I'll keep my ships separated, except for raiding tombs.

We'll see how it all goes...

# Game 8

## Playbook

Since most islands have been discovered at this point, and many of the sites on these islands have been explored, the goods are no longer being produced in the islands closest to the home harbor. Up to this point, I was able to operate entirely within the starting islands that lie in front of the deep ocean. That will no longer be the case going forward. (As an aside, though I have found success as a merchant I have had to forgo exploring, which means I don't visit the Captain's Booke very often. This is one of the best parts of the game, so I do lament that I actively avoid the Explorers Guild.)

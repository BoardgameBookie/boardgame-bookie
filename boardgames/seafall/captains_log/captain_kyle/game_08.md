# Game 8

## Playbook

All the normal islands have been discovered at this point, and many of the sites on these islands have been explored. Up to this point, I was able to operate mostly within the starting islands that lie in front of the deep ocean, but will that remain true? As an aside, though I have found success as a merchant I have had to forgo exploring, which means I don't visit the Captain's Booke very often. This is one of the best parts of the game, so I do lament that I actively avoid the Explorers' Guild. In fact, I never discovered an island and I've never explored a tomb. One might look at the standings and conclude this is why I sit in last place, but I would argue it is not that straightforward.

One thing I love about legacy games, and SeaFall in particular, is that the rules are always changing and the board is always changing. The best strategy must be discovered through experimentation and not all experiments are successful. To this point I've been trying to succeed through econonomics, but have yet to discover the right mix of commerce and trade. Of course, I'm still set on founding a colony (or two), but as I discovered last game this is no easy task.

Thankfully, this time around I have the hold necessary to build a colony without having to upgrade a ship. This should lower the barrier to founding a colony significantly.

# Game 8

## Playbook

All the normal islands have been discovered at this point, and many of the sites on these islands have been explored. Up to this point, I was able to operate mostly within the starting islands that lie in front of the deep ocean, but that is no longer possible. As an aside, though I have found success as a merchant I have had to forgo exploring, which means I don't visit the Captain's Booke very often. This is one of the best parts of the game, so I do lament that I actively avoid the Explorers' Guild. In fact, I never discovered an island and I've never explored a tomb. One might look at the standings and conclude this is why I sit in last place, but I would argue it is not that straightforward.

One thing I love about legacy games, and SeaFall in particular, is that the rules are always changing and the board is always changing. The best strategy must be discovered through experimentation and not all experiments are successful. To this point I've been trying to succeed through economics, but have yet to discover the right mix of commerce and trade. Of course, I'm still set on founding a colony (or two), but as I discovered last game this is no small task.

Thankfully, this time around I have the hold necessary to build a colony without having to upgrade a ship. This should lower the barrier to founding a colony significantly. I'd like to explore a tomb, too, since most remaining endeavors within are raid based, and I still command the deadliest ship, Adamantium. The rewards from the tombs have fueled almost every game victory since the mechanic was introduced. Typically, the recipe is a player grabs a powerful advisor with an expertise in explorer. In our game a few have explore+ in excess of 5, one even has +9! Then this player will raid a tomb twice, once in year 1 and another in year 2 when the powerful advisor refreshes, and each endeavor results in +5 glory and a tablet or relic to boot. That means 10 glory in 2 turns and it doesn't take much more to cross the finish line after this.

If I'm going after a tomb I need to plan contingencies for the potential rewards at the end. However, before reaching this point I'll found a colony right out of the gate, and in the meantime I'll be looking for a powerful raid advisor.

My opening drive:

* (Turn 1) Sail A (Adamantium) to Prussia and B to Windy. Buy L,W in Prussia.
* Buy I,L,S,S in Windy. Sail B to Prussia.
* Found tax+4 colony in Prussia. Sail toward Candyland.
* Sail to Candyland. Raid 8-mine.

If the tombs are closed...

* (Turn 5) Buy I,I in Candyland. Sail to Windy.
* Sail B to Prussia. Build a Gun Tower with I.
* Move W from the colony winter-collection to Ship B. Sail B to Windy. Buy 4 I,L,S,S in Windy.
* Sail to Candyland. Found enmity colony.
* Raid 10-mine and tax.
* Buy 2 goods with Ship A at Taco Bell or Candyland. Ship B sails towards Prussia.
* Buy 4 goods in Prussia with Ship B. Sail A towards Windy.
* (Turn 12) Found buy+2 in Windy.

If the tombs are open...

* (Turn 5) Sail to Taco Bell. Buy I,W.
* Sail to Hangry. Explore the Chasm of Echoes.

If tomb yields gold...

* (Turn 7) Pay someone a reputation for Guild Hall use and cycle to the Surveyor. Sail towards Candyland. Buy missing goods in Taco Bell or Candyland.
* Sail to Candyland. Found the enmity colony.

If tomb yields a tablet or relic...

* (Turn 7) Explore the tomb again, the Unfinished Chamber.

If tomb yields goods...

* (Turn 7) Sail towards Candyland. Buy missing goods in Taco Bell or Candyland.
* Sail to Candyland. Found the enmity colony.

My primary goal is to found two colonies and hope for some extra glory in the tombs. This plan has the most branches simply due to the variety of prizes found within the tombs. I'll need to hope for a very powerful raid advisor, because the bar to succeed unscathed at a tomb is very high. If I don't get the advisor I'll have 2 gold to spare for a Guild Hall run, or I'll just follow the plan for closed tombs.


## Play-by-play

TLDR. I had another bad game and have now ended the last two games in last place. Game 7 was a disaster, because Joe deployed (Randy) The Savage upon a goods laden ship, sinking my game plan along with the ship. I suppose I had that coming after my reign of terror as the groups' token pirate.

Game 8 was just a good old fashion case of bad luck. A new wrinkle to game was the influence the event deck played. Typically, the event deck has only had a minimal effect on the gameplay, with the strong success bonuses being the most influential. However, the first card drawn from the event deck was bad for my plans. The skull temple was discovered close to the starting islands and any ships within 3 spaces would take 2 damage at the end of the round. Unfortunately, my plan required that I buy goods the first two rounds from these very same islands. I determined the risk to be too great, so I had to punt on my first turn. I literally did nothing, but tax! This was incredibly frustrating, but it threw everyone else off their game, too, so I suppose I cannot gripe too much. However, some people had great build advisors and were able to have productive first turns.

I decided to remove the buying step I would have made in turn 5 and followed the plan as drawn out. Thankfully, this time around no one attacked me and I was able to found my tax+4 colony in Prussia. I felt like the game was really starting to turn my way when Randy appeared in the advisors forum, top-decked by Dave whose turn preceded mine. I got the most powerful raid advisor! Amazingly, I was also able to pick up The Pirate advisor and raided the 10-mine on Candyland (Joe raided the 8-mine it turned out). I had a colony and a small pile of gold, which is right where I wanted to be.

I sailed into Hangry on turn 6 that a 9-tomb open. I had Randy and both ships, which gave me a healthy sized pool of 13 dice. I had 2 fortune tokens. I could not be better prepared. This was a best case scenario, and yet, despite the odds being strongly in my favor, disaster struck and I failed during my tomb raid! It was an epic failure. Of the 13 dice I rolled only 5 were a success. 5 out of 13! It was a ridiculous result. The math says there was a less than 1% chance of this happening. I needed 7 successes to escape the tomb unscathed, which I had a 90% chance of hitting. Those are phenomenal odds in SeaFall. I was just dumbstruck.

Since I rolled a 5 against a 9 I had to spend my two fortune to help prevent sinking. Then, to pile on, since I didn't sink I still had to resolve the tomb. My reward was to make a difficult choice. Discard 2 advisors or take 2 damage and receive 15 gold. I didn't want to lose Randy, so I chose to take 4 damage. Miraculously, I didn't sink (40% chance of this outcome), but my boat was crippled. The worst card I pulled was a curse that prevented my big boat from using an advisor as the flagship. This meant I couldn't use Randy again to raid the tomb on turn 7 after it reactivated. This was by far the worst roll I've had during the game. The timing was pretty awful considering it prevented me from making up ground in the overall game.

I had some gold now, which was nice, so I thought to start buying more goods for a colony on turn 7. However, I did not get very far towards this goal, because turn 7 was the last turn of the game. Just like game 7, game 8 ended lighting quick. This time Scott schooled everyone. He had phenomenal success raiding the tombs twice for 10 glory, and then raided an island site that game him an additional 4. I think this is another example of cluster-luck with the explore mechanic. Scott benefited from everyone else abandoning the exploration mechanic. In all games prior to this one, at least 3 of the 5 players went full-explore. This was the first game only one player, Scott, went exploring and he greatly benefited. I've been trying to pick a strategy that others' were avoiding, but now I find myself in an intense competition for colonies.

I've been trying zig as others have zagged, and this worked for a time when the milestones where based on the Merchants Guild. There was a 3 game stretch where I was successful enough to hold 2nd place in the overall game. Unfortunately, the usefulness of the Merchants Guild has been greatly diminished since the introduction of the colonies mechanic, because selling goods is counter productive to founding a colony. The current milestones are colony based, so this greatly incentivizes pursuing this strategy. Unfortunately, I haven't found that the legacy elements I've acquired have translated to the founding of colonies. If I am to make a comeback in this game, I'm going to need the remaining milestones to involve the Merchants Guild or Raid Guild where I have an advantage in my province stats.

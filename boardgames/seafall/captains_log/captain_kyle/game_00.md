# Prologue

## Playbook

Heading into the prologue I had no plan. I had lightly skimmed the rule book, but expected to learn the rules by playing the prologue.

## Play-by-play

I ended up winning the prologue, but there was no benefit. In fact, it felt like a slight penalty, because I had to start last during the first game.

The biggest lesson learned, I think for everyone, was the value of exploration. I won primarily, because I spent every turn exploring. It seemed clear that the Explorer's Guild gave the highest expected glory per action.

Gameplay aside, it was a surprise when we had to destroy the leaders we chose to start the prologue, and funny, too, because as a result of the twist, as a group of five men, we are now entirely led by women avatars.

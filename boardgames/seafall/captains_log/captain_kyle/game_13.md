# Game 13
## Clues to the puzzle before Game 13

### Three words (the names and order of tablets)
* Worn, Ancient, Cryptic
* Inscribed, Eroded, Sacred
* Worn, Fractured, Eroded

### Where to shine the light
* On the front and back of advisors.
* On tablets
* On the tomb map

### Other advice
* Do not venture West without reading what the ancients had to say.
* We should gather our leaders in the temple, but bad things might happen.

## Playbook
The keys to my game:
1. Back to the tombs. There is still more glory within.
1. Interrogate every turn
1. Found a colony.
1. Operation Roman Senate
1. (Bonus Mission) Conquer the colony at Arados.

### SeaFall Master Plan
* I need 2 high impact raid advisors
* **Advisor Watchlist** (67% chance of appearing on the winter flop)
   1. The Cannoneer (+6)
   1. The Grizzled Veteran (+2 fortune)
   1. The Pirate
   1. The Savage (+9)
   1. The Soldier's Patron
* **Secondary Advisor Watchlist** (if none of the above are available... >73% chance of finding primary or secondary advisor on the winter flop)
   1. The Blackmailer
   1. The Builder's Patron
   1. The Contractor
   1. The Foreman
   1. The Keeper of Lore (if in Arados)
   1. The Politician (if short on coin)
   1. The Surveyor (if short on colony)

#### First Winter
* I am 12 points behind the leader, so I get 3 bonuses.
   * 2 fortune bonuses and 3g
* Starting gold is 12g (home province fields) + 3g (rubble fields) + 3g (title bonus)
* Activate Kites for -6g
* Activate Taxachusetts -6g
* 3g (kites), 3g (rubble), wood (Taxachusetts)
* Place relic on Amazon Prime Now.
* **12 gold, 3 glory**

#### Turn 1
* Use reputation to acquire an advisor (or two) if it can be interrogated or helps build/upgrade
* Upgrade Adamantium with Endurance -10g
* Build the Guild Hall in Taxachusetts -2g and wood
* **0 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* Keep eye out for key raid advisors or advisors to interrogate.
* Activate Master Thief advisor
* Sail to Kites
* Tax with the Master Thief and take gold from Mike (+3g base, +2g advisor, +4g colony = 9g)
  * Return an enmity token to Mike
* **9g gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 3
* Use Guild Hall to find key Raid advisor
* Sail to Arados
* Explore the tomb.
  * We'll want to be very aggressive with our dice rolling.
  * The tomb has a defense of 12. Do not include enmity since it is an explore endeavor.
* **9 gold, 5 glory**

#### Turn 4
* Use Guild Hall to find key Raid advisor (it might have to be the Pirate per Operation Roman Senate)
* Explore the tomb
* Sail to Macy's Paradise
* **9 gold, 6 glory**

#### Turn 5
* Try to find The Politician (spending up to 6 coin is cost neutral) or grab a +tax advisor if available
* Raid 8 mine
  * Make sure you have enough enmity for Operation Roman Senate
* Tax (+3g base, +4g colony = 7g)
* Buy treasure with The Politician power (maybe).
  * Check how many goods/coin we'll need to build a colony. Macy's Paradise will net an additional 6g in the Winter. The Surveyor can substitute goods for 8g each when building a colony.
* **26g gold, 7 glory**

#### Turn 6
* Use Guild Hall to find The Surveyor if needed
* Found colony at Macy's Paradise with cash or goods
* If not possible to found colony, search for The Treasure Hunter and Research
* Sail to Candyland
* **30 gold, 12 glory**

#### Second winter
* Fields gold 12g home, 3g x 4 at colonies
* 3g from (kites), 3g (rubble), 3g (macy's), wood (Taxachusetts)
* 24g from fields and 9g from colony bonus = 33g
* **63 gold, 12 glory**

#### Turn 6
* If no colony at Macy's, try to found colony in Candyland.
* If there is a colony at Macy's then...
  * Try to find The Politician (spending up to 6 coin is cost neutral)
  * Raid 8 mine
    * This will cost 2 enmity since I would own the colony on this island. Make sure you have enough enmity for the big showdown with Mike. Look for an advisor that reduces enmity (aka The Pirate), or forgo the raid if enmity is limited.
  * Tax (+3g base, +6g advisor, +4g colony = 13g)
  * Buy treasure with The Politician power (maybe).
    * Check how many goods/coin we'll need to build a colony. Macy's Paradise will net an additional 6g in the Winter. The Surveyor can substitute goods for 8g each when building a colony.
* **30 gold, 8 glory**

#### Turn 7
* Build a structure or research
* Sail to Kites

#### Turn 8+
* Sail to Mike's province
* Destroy his tablet structure. Ideally, the game will end on this turn.

### If it is clear the game will end

#### Turn 6
* Find the Navigator with the Guild Hall
* Found the Macy's paradise colony
* Take both ships back to port

#### Turn 7
* Sail to Mike's province.
* Destroy his tablet structure.

### Raiding Tortosa
#### Turn 4
* Raid the tomb
  * Tortosa colony has a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10. To conquer Tortosa I must raid it without taking damage.
  * Adamantium has base raid of 7. Amazon will add support of 1 (dice pool of 8).
  * We lose two dice to the garrison and 1 to enmity (8 - 3 = dice pool of 5).
  * Endurance gives a strong success bonus.
    * Rolling with anything less than a dice pool of 11 is unadvised. Rolling with 13 would be the sweet-spot in terms of diminishing returns on success.
    * dice pool of 10 is ~58% chance of success
    * dice pool of 11 is ~71% chance of success
    * dice pool of 12 is ~81% chance of success
    * **dice pool of 13 is ~89% chance of success**
    * dice pool of 14 is ~93% chance of success

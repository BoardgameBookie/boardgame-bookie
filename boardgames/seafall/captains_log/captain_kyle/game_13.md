# Game 13
## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Conquer the colony at Arados. Can I get there fast enough? Will I be strong enough?

1. Back to the tombs. There is still more glory within.

1. Convince someone to raid Mike's council room before his first turn. This would greatly slow him down. He has so many tablets and if cannot stop him from collecting more we'll never catch up to him.

1. Pursue the chart at the end of the world. Mike built the observatory, which proved to be useful. Knowing the research card before using the action is valuable.

### Key Advisors
* The Keeper of Lore: When Keeper of Lore becomes your active advisor, draw the top four cards of the Research deck and keep two.
* The Ninth Initiate (or others that shine the light of truth on the forum): When the Ninth Initiate becomes your active advisor, shine the light of truth on advisors in the forum. You must hire all private society members for free. You may take a card from any treasure room that doesn't have enmity on it. Place four enmity on that treasure room. This is not a raid or endeavor.
* The Seeker of Answers: When Seeker of Answers becomes your active advisor, you must take an advisor from a province's council room (if it doesn't have enmity on it). Place two enmity tokens on that council room. You may use as many goods as you want to discount a build action this turn.

# Game 13
## Clues to the puzzle before Game 13

### Three words (the names and order of tablets)
* Worn, Ancient, Cryptic
* Inscribed, Eroded, Sacred
* Worn, Fractured, Eroded

### Where to shine the light
* On the front and back of advisors.
* On tablets
* On the tomb map

### Other advice
* Do not venture West without reading what the ancients had to say.
* We should gather our leaders in the temple, but bad things might happen.

## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Back to the tombs. There is still more glory within.

1. Interrogate every turn.

1. Found a colony.

1. Convince Scott to raid Mike's council room before his first turn. This would greatly slow him down. He has so many tablets and if we cannot stop him from collecting more we'll never catch up to him.

1. (Bonus Mission) Conquer the colony at Arados.

### Key Advisors
* The Ninth Initiate (or others that shine the light of truth on the forum): When the Ninth Initiate becomes your active advisor, shine the light of truth on advisors in the forum. You must hire all private society members for free. You may take a card from any treasure room that doesn't have enmity on it. Place four enmity on that treasure room. This is not a raid or endeavor.
* The Seeker of Answers: When Seeker of Answers becomes your active advisor, you must take an advisor from a province's council room (if it doesn't have enmity on it). Place two enmity tokens on that council room. You may use as many goods as you want to discount a build action this turn.

### SeaFall Master Plan

#### First Winter
* I am 12 points behind the leader, so I get 3 bonuses.
   * 3 gold bonuses
* Starting gold is 12g (home province fields) + 3g (rubble fields) + 9g (title bonus)
* Activate Kites for -6g
* Activate Taxachusetts -6g
* Iron for a colony (kites), 3g (rubble), wood (Taxachusetts)
* Place relic on Amazon Prime Now.
* **15 gold, 3 glory**

#### Turn 1
* **Advisor Watchlist** (67% chance of appearing on the winter flop)
   1. The Arsonist
   1. The Advanced Scout
   1. The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel
   1. The Cannoneer
   1. The Grizzled Veteran
   1. The Master of Munitions
   1. The Master Thief
   1. The Patriot
   1. The Pirate
   1. The Renowned Soldier
   1. The Savage
   1. The Soldier's Patron
   1. The Tinker
   1. The Wind Master
* **Secondary Advisor Watchlist** (if none of the above are available... >73% chance of finding primary or secondary advisor on the winter flop)
   1. The Blackmailer
   1. The Builder's Patron
   1. The Contractor
   1. The Foreman
   1. The Politician
   1. The Surveyor

* Upgrade Adamantium with Endurance -10g
* Build the Guild Hall in Taxachusetts -2g and wood
* **3 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* Sail to Kites
* Tax with the Master Thief and take gold from Mike (+3g base, +2g advisor, +4g colony = 9g)
* **12 gold, 4 glory**


#### Turn 2
* Sail to Arados
* Raid the tomb.
  * We'll want to be very aggressive with our dice rolling.
  * The tomb has a defense of 12 and I have an enmity on the island.
* **12 gold, 5 glory**

#### Turn 3
* Raid the tomb
  * Tortosa colony has a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10. To conquer Tortosa I must raid it without taking damage.
  * Adamantium has base raid of 7. Amazon will add support of 1 (dice pool of 8).
  * We lose two dice to the garrison (8 - 2 = dice pool of 6).
  * Endurance gives a nice strong success bonus.
    * Rolling with anything less than a dice pool of 11 is unadvised. Rolling with 13 would be the sweet-spot in terms of diminishing returns on success.
    * dice pool of 10 is ~58% chance of success
    * dice pool of 11 is ~71% chance of success
    * dice pool of 12 is ~81% chance of success
    * **dice pool of 13 is ~89% chance of success**
    * dice pool of 14 is ~93% chance of success
* Research
* **9 gold, 6 glory**

#### Turn 4
* Raid the tomb or Conquer Tortosa
* Sail to Macy's Paradise
* **9 gold, 7 glory**

#### Turn 5
* Try to find The Politician (spending up to 6 coin is cost neutral)
* Raid 8 mine
  * This will cost 2 enmity since I would own the colony on this island. Make sure you have enough enmity for the big showdown with Mike. Look for an advisor that reduces enmity (aka The Pirate), or forgo the raid if enmity is limited.
* Tax (+3g base, +6g advisor, +4g colony = 13g)
* Buy treasure with The Politician power (maybe).
  * Check how many goods/coin we'll need to build a colony. Macy's Paradise will net an additional 6g in the Winter. The Surveyor can substitute goods for 8g each when building a colony.
* **30 gold, 8 glory**

#### Turn 6
  * If possible, found colony at Macy's Paradise with cash or goods
  * If not possible, search for The Treasure Hunter and Research
  * Sail to Candyland
* **30 gold, 12 glory**

#### Second winter
* Fields gold 12g home, 3g x 4 at colonies
* 3g from (kites), 3g (rubble), 3g (macy's), wood (Taxachusetts)
* 24g from fields and 9g from colony bonus = 33g
* **63 gold, 12 glory**

#### Turn 7
* Found colony
* Sail to Kites

#### Turn 8
* Sail to Kites
* Build a structure

#### Turn 9
* Sail to Mike's province
* Destroy his tablet structure. Ideally, the game will end on this turn.

### If it is clear the game will end

#### Turn 6
* Find the Navigator with the Guild Hall
* Found the Macy's paradise colony
* Take both ships back to port

#### Turn 7
* Sail to Mike's province.
* Destroy his tablet structure.

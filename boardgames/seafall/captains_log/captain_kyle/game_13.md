# Game 13
## Clues to the puzzle before Game 13

### Three words (the names and order of tablets)
* Worn, Ancient, Cryptic
* Inscribed, Eroded, Sacred
* Worn, Fractured, Eroded

### Where to shine the light
* On the front and back of advisors.
* On tablets
* On the tomb map

### Other advice
* Do not venture West without reading what the ancients had to say.
* We should gather our leaders in the temple, but bad things might happen.

## Playbook

The keys to my game:

1. Conquer the colony at Arados.

1. Back to the tombs. There is still more glory within.

1. Found a colony.

1. Convince someone to raid Mike's council room before his first turn. This would greatly slow him down. He has so many tablets and if we cannot stop him from collecting more we'll never catch up to him.

### Key Advisors
* The Ninth Initiate (or others that shine the light of truth on the forum): When the Ninth Initiate becomes your active advisor, shine the light of truth on advisors in the forum. You must hire all private society members for free. You may take a card from any treasure room that doesn't have enmity on it. Place four enmity on that treasure room. This is not a raid or endeavor.
* The Seeker of Answers: When Seeker of Answers becomes your active advisor, you must take an advisor from a province's council room (if it doesn't have enmity on it). Place two enmity tokens on that council room. You may use as many goods as you want to discount a build action this turn.

### SeaFall Master Plan

#### First Winter
* I am 12 points behind the leader, so I get 3 bonuses.
   * 3 gold bonuses
* Starting gold is 12g (home province) + 3g (rubble) + 9g (title bonus)
* Activate Kites for -6g
* Activate Taxachusetts -6g
* 3g from (kites), 3g (rubble), wood (Taxachusetts)
* Place relic on Amazon Prime Now.
* **18 gold, 3 glory**

#### Turn 1
* Pay the gold price for an advisor, unless the advisor has a raid bonus of 2 more than the reputation cost.
* **Advisor Watchlist** (67% chance of appearing on the winter flop)
   1. The Arsonist
   1. The Advanced Scout
   1. The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel
   1. The Cannoneer
   1. The Grizzled Veteran
   1. The Master of Munitions
   1. The Master Thief
   1. The Patriot
   1. The Pirate
   1. The Renowned Soldier
   1. The Savage
   1. The Soldier's Patron
   1. The Tinker
   1. The Wind Master
* **Secondary Advisor Watchlist** (if none of the above are available... >73% chance of finding primary or secondary advisor on the winter flop)
   1. The Blackmailer
   1. The Builder's Patron
   1. The Contractor
   1. The Foreman
   1. The Politician

* Upgrade Adamantium with Endurance -10g
* Build the Guild Hall in Taxachusetts -2g and wood
* **6 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* Sail to Kites
* Tax with the Master Thief and take gold from Mike (+3g base, +2g advisor, +4g colony = 9g)
* **15 gold, 4 glory**


#### Turn 2
* Sail to Arados
* Raid the tomb.

* **11 gold, 10 glory**

#### Turn 3
* Raid the tomb or Conquer Tortosa
   Tortosa colony has a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10. To conquer Tortosa I must raid it without taking damage.
  * Adamantium has base raid of 7. Amazon will add support of 1 (dice pool of 8).
  * We lose two dice to the garrison (8 - 2 = dice pool of 6).
  * Endurance gives a nice strong success bonus.
     * Rolling with anything less than a dice pool of 11 is unadvised. Rolling with 13 would be the sweet-spot in terms of diminishing returns on success.
     * dice pool of 10 is ~58% chance of success
     * dice pool of 11 is ~71% chance of success
     * dice pool of 12 is ~81% chance of success
     * **dice pool of 13 is ~89% chance of success**
     * dice pool of 14 is ~93% chance of success
* Research or Tax

#### Turn 4
* Raid the tomb or Conquer Tortosa
* Research or Tax

#### Turn 5
*

#### Turn 6
*

#### Second winter

#### Turn 7

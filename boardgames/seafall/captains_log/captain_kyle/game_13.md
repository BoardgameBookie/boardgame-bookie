### Raiding Tortosa
* Tortosa colony has a garrison of 2 and a red defense of 10. To conquer Tortosa I must raid it without taking damage.

* We lose two dice to the garrison and 1 to enmity (8 - 3 = dice pool of 5).
* Endurance gives a strong success bonus.
  * Rolling with anything less than a dice pool of 11 is unadvised. Rolling with 13 would be the sweet-spot in terms of diminishing returns on success.

  * dice pool of 11 is ~71% chance of success
  * dice pool of 12 is ~81% chance of success
  * **dice pool of 13 is ~89% chance of success**
  * dice pool of 14 is ~93% chance of success

## Play-by-play
I really liked my plan going into the game, but as it has happened so many times before, my plans went off the rails by turn 2 and I had to adjust on the fly. Thankfully my plan was fairly modular and despite not accomplishing all of my goals I still ended up winning the game with a little luck. Game 13 was a wild one!

Dave, Joe, Scott, and I decided to gang up on Mike heading into the game. We created a plan called Operation Roman Senate and Mike was code-named Caesar. The whole plan hinged on each of us antagonizing Mike in a different way, but the main part of the plan was to have Scott strike early before Mike even took a turn. Unfortunately, Scott got cold feet and Operation Roman Senate turned out to be a spectacular failure from a planning stand point; I suppose it is only fitting, because the plan to assassinate Caesar did not exactly go according to plan, either. Mike did exactly what we suspected and stole a tablet from Scott using the crazy Patmos advisor.

I executed my first turn as planned and got the enduring upgrade and a guild hall.

My contribution to the effort was to tax Mike on turn 2 for 9 gold using the Master Thief. However, Mike only had 7 gold in his vault and I actually would have "helped" him, because he wanted to activate his tablet to receive 12 gold after hitting zero coin. Therefore, I decided to audible. I recruited The Soldier's Patron and activated him to boost my tax and got 9 gold anyways. Mike did manage to hit 0 coin and refill his vault using his tablet. All in the same turn he also sold a wood he had received from a colony for 12 gold using The Woodsman advisor that was sitting in the forum. Mike had the strong start we all feared.

Dave came roaring out of the gates. He was so far behind he had 5 bonuses that he cashed out for coin. His first move was to build the relic structure. He had 3 relics to start with (and ends up with 4), so after the first turn he ended up with 7 glory for a single building!

On my third turn I headed to Arados as planned, but as fate would have it a +3 tax event card was in effect. I picked up the Cannoneer (+5 raid) without having to use the Guild Hall, ironically, but I refrained from jumping into the tomb. Instead, I used the Master Thief a turn later against Mike, and instead of taking 9 coin from his vault I took 12! That felt good.

On turn four I jumped into the tomb and mustered up a dice pool of 13! My roll (with the Enduring upgrade) was so good I didn't even have to use any fortune. I guessed correctly on the tomb map and came away with the last tablet in the game. Awesome!

Though Scott pulled his punch the rest of us did not. Dave got after one of Mike's ships that he left alone and took a relic. Joe hit Mike where it hurt and stole a tablet; the best part is Joe used The Patriot and only had to give Mike a single enmity. Mike did manage to make his tablet structure, but he was starting to falter; we were getting to him little by little.

Meanwhile, an event card that dealt 1 damage to every ship "at an island with your enmity" at the end of the round made me adjust my plans again. Instead of diving back into the tomb I left after exploring the first time to avoid the damage and headed to Macy's, but without any goods to form a colony. In retrospect I should have probably just taken the damage, but it still felt early in the game at the time. I was monopolizing all of the raid advisors in the game by cycling through the advisor deck. This drove Scott crazy, because apparently he desperately wanted a raid adviser and he never got one, because of my strategy. I got The Pirate (+4 raid) and took the mine in Macy's and taxed, too; the tax colony is really, really good BTW.

I was starting to rack up some coin, but it became clear founding a colony was now out of the picture. Unfortunately, I The Surveyor had been picked up by Dave and founding a colony with coin was out of the question. I began to focus on how take out Mike's tablet structure, but I had a problem, because I didn't have enough enmity to raid his structure. I had three enmity tokens on my provinces and Dave had another at the start of the game; I need 5. Dave and I discussed how he would attack my ship and steal the relic and this way I could get my enmity token back and I could attack Mike.

As fate would have it, this plan would not work out, but instead I lucked into a better path to glory. I was so far out to sea it would take 3 turns just to sail back to the ports. Dave and my ships were so far apart we couldn't quite coordinate. It was then, by chance, that I noticed The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel in the forum and his ability is to reclaim enmity tokens. Perfect! I was sitting on a pile of cash, owned the Patmos colony, and bought this 8 coin advisor, 12 for me because I had 4 enmity on Patmos for Ker. Scott verbally lamented yet again that I messed up his plans, but what happened next drove him crazy.

I messed up the order of my turn, but usually everyone is usually pretty relaxed with the rules. I activated the Bloodthirsty scoundrel and raided a mine. Before ending my turn I announced I had intended to interrogate The Scoundrel, but forgot to do so at the start of my turn. Everyone was okay with me doing so, but something special was revealed. For the first time in our game a chart to the last island was discovered, and I found it! I'd get a milestone, too. However, in the Captain's Booke the text told me to dismiss The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel; except I had just used him in a raid. All of a sudden it became glaringly obvious why we need to follow the order of operations. The group decided I had to rescind my interrogation and keep The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel. I'd have to wait a turn to interrogate him, but now everyone knew this advisor was special and Joe was in position to steal it from me.

For the next round I felt very dumb and awkward. I was embarrassed for doing my turn out of order and causing some confusion, and I was upset that I was about to lose a significant and important moment in the game. I waited anxiously for Joe's turn. Winter came and went and he got to refresh The Patriot. He had the numbers and The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel was his for the taking. On Joe's turn he picked up his ships and started to move them towards the port of my province, but wait! His hand passed over my port and kept going. Instead of me he decided to attack Scott and take another one of his tablets! I was shocked and on a roller coaster. I was elated when I became the first to find a chart, then devastated that I'd lose this distinction to Joe, but now I was back on top of the world. Joe spared me and I asked him why after the game. He said he was more interested in collecting tablets to find the secrets to the statues, but I think he forgot there was a milestone attached to finding the first chart.

This was all too much for Scott to bear. He felt like I took The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel from him. Then he was flabbergasted that Joe would take a tablet from him instead of take The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel from me. I was just as shocked as Scott, but he was on the opposite end of the outcome. Scott was having the worst of games.

I didn't have a clear plan of action anymore after all the excitement. I gave up on taking out Mike's structure, because I realized it would hurt me more than it would hurt him in the end. Though I had enough enmity to destroy it, I'd lose just as much glory since my enmity permanent enmity already filled 5 of his 6 slots. My luck continued when I interrogated The Builder's Patron and found another chart! That means as a group we've identified 2 of the 4. I did commit a player error here that cost me a glory when I didn't check to see how much treasures cost. I had the option to build two structures with The Builder's Patron, but I only built 1. I was left with 51 coins, when I needed 52 for the big 4 glory treasure. I've lost a glory here and there throughout all the games from bad coin math, but this one stung in the end: I won the round by piecing together raids and interrogating the right advisors, but ended up in an overall tie with Mike! That one glory would have put me in the lead.

This sets up game 14 to be something of a race to the finish. Joe and Mike are firmly entrenched in the tablet game to find the secrets to the statues. While the rewards are big, the tablets might ultimately be a distraction from the big prize: that final island. I don't have any dogs in the tablet race, so my goal is to discover that island before they realize it's too late to stop me. I think I have a shot at it in game 14, but it is going to take some planning and luck. We learned that the charts are on the backs of advisor cards and that there is one chart on the highest ranking society member in each guild. The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel is the Soldier's Guild. The Builder's Patron is the Builder's Guild. I've got a hunch about The Court Wizard as the Explorer's Guild chart bearer. I'm not sure who could be the Merchant's Guild leader. Perhaps the Merchant's Patron? The Noble? The Master Smuggler? I'll need help from a powerful advisor like The Walker of Paths. I think if I can find 3 of 4 charts I've got a reason to roll the dice.

A final note, It took until the end of the 13th game to upgrade my first explore stat on one of my ships. I resisted following an exploration strategy, because those were some bloody waters. I wanted to zig while everyone else zagged. Now that the greatest challenge is an explore endeavor I've got to get as much help as I can get.

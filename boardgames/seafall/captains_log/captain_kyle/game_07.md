# Game 7

## Playbook

I started SeaFall as an explorer. I began dabbling in the pirate trade during the 2nd game, raiding islands. By the 3rd game I had become a full-on pirate, waiting for unsuspecting victims to appear on the high seas. I think the pirate's life found me, because I didn't set out to antagonize my fellow players. However, when I've struggled with the merchant trade, applying my cannons to gain glory appeared to be the next best approach.

To ensure securing a milestone in the last two games I've had to attack Joe and Dave at their home ports. I've been in 2nd place for several games, so permanent enmity has accrued in the provinces of the players below me. I've also been aggressive acquiring advisors, so I haven't been able to clear enmity off the islands I've raided with leftover reputation tokens. Now after 6 games, I look at the board and glaring back are the unfriendly stickers my past aggressions have littered upon the sea.

| | Dave | Joe | Kyle | Mike | Scott | islands | Total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Dave** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | **3** |
| **Joe** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| **Kyle** | 3 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **13** |
| **Mike** | 0 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 1 | 0 | **8** |
| **Scott** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |

My total permanent enmity dwarves my fellow players. Mike is the only exception, but, when considering 6 of his enmity reside in my port, it is clear his number is inflated by a single (terrible for me) raid that took place in game 2 and is not the result from sustained raiding, aka pirate-life.

I am making this assessment to point out that my pirating days must, by necessity, come to an end. I am at a disadvantage against every player and this only figures to get worse if I am able to capture pole position.

My strategy for the next game is to establish a colony (or two). Mike has helped me shape this strategy and we are consulting each other to ensure we won't accidentally step on each others' toes. I think we're incentivized to work together, because it is fun to think big, first and foremost, and if one of us turns on the other we can each expect a tit-for-tat retaliation; the enmity system in the game beautifully captures this tension. If all goes according to plan both of us will have 2 colonies each by the end of turn 8! This plan is the most elaborate I've brought into a game by far. It feels like we've entered a more strategic phase of the game, and a significant contributing factor is the high cost of founding a colony. It takes several turns to collect all the goods necessary. An additional challenge in this round will be starting with a collective hold of 5, which is 1 short of the requirement for a colony.

The joint plan resembles a Rube Goldberg machine where our ships will be crisscrossing each other across the ocean, bouncing from island-to-island. Every turn is crucial and there is virtually no room for error. This has me somewhat worried, because Dave, Joe, and Scott represent a great deal of unknown. Despite this, the plan does not hinge on reaching a milestone, so there isn't direct competition per say. I'll also be testing Joe's ability to hold a grudge. If he wants to ruin my day and attack a ship he may have a small window of opportunity. However, if I am able to secure the Hold+1 upgrade, raiding my fast ship will be a terrifying proposition.

This plan is so epic that Mike and I have had to plan multiple contingencies, so we can adjust in case the waters get rough. To have both Mike I walk away from game 7 with 2 colonies a piece will require us to work together. We've simulated several playthroughs and finding the ideal partition of goods between us was not obvious. It took some trial and error, but we found a solution that still maintains some flexibility for the unforeseen. I had a lot of fun scheming with Mike. This is by far the most intricate plan to date and I've invested an order of magnitude more thought into this plan than any prior game. I cannot wait to see what happens! So much fun!

## Play-by-play

I was so eager to start this round, but the game played out like a Shakespearean tragedy. Though I tried to leave the pirate life behind, I could not escape my past. It just so happened that my worst case scenario played out and I had no contingency plan to recover from it: Joe attacked me on turn 2, sinking my boat along with all of its goods. It was a perfect storm of sorts:

1. Joe was looking for revenge.
2. Joe acquired Randy the Savage, +7 to raid, who was drawn just prior to Joe's turn, which is terrible luck on its own (and funny this happened last game, too, with Dave and The Donald).
3. Joe's boats hadn't yet gone out to the deep ocean to raid tombs. Had a high attack advisor shown up after turn 2, Joe's ships would have been too far away to reach me.

The attack on my boat might have been the most devastating of all PvP raids if they were to be enumerated. I lost all of my goods. I lost a turn repairing my ship. I had no money after having spent it all on goods. This is yet another hurdle to founding a colony. There is a lot of resources, time and coin, floating on the ocean for several turns before a colony can be founded.

To make matters worse, the game ended rapidly at 7 turns. Just as I had begun to recover the game stopped short. I was one turn away from founding a colony! Ug. The loss was terrible and complete. I only managed 3 glory and dropped from 2nd place overall to last place!

Mike was able to follow his plan as conceived, but having the game end at turn 7 stymied him as well; he was also 1 turn away from founding a second colony.

The loss really stung and I did my best to stay composed. I laughed it all off as it was happening, but felt great disappointment that all the work I had put into the plan ended up meaning nothing; there must be a life lesson in there somewhere. My brother, Reid, was my co-captain for the game and it certainly hurt my pride to be humiliated so thoroughly in front of him. Alas! Yet this is why I love playing boardgames. There are incredible highs and lows that go along with each thrilling victory or crushing defeat.

I am concerned how the results of game 7 will impact my future rounds. I was really counting on founding at least 1 colony, but as it turns out I would have been better off not even showing up to play the game. I left 2 permanent enmity at Candyland and I'll need to raid it again to get multiple colonies the next game, I think. The only silver lining is that Joe's bloodlust is seemingly satisfied. I collected 3 of his permanent enmity at the end of the game, so it would be a taller order to attack me again anyways.

# Game 7

## Playbook

I started SeaFall as an explorer. I began dabbling in the pirate trade during the 2nd game, raiding islands. By the 3rd game I had become a full-on pirate, waiting for unsuspecting victims to appear on the high seas. I think the pirate's life found me, because I didn't set out to antagonize my fellow players. However, when I've struggled with the merchant trade, applying my cannons to gain glory appeared to be the next best approach.

To ensure securing a milestone in the last two games I've had to attack Joe and Dave at their home ports. I've been in 2nd place for several games, so permanent enmity has accrued in the provinces of the players below me. I've also been aggressive acquiring advisors, so I haven't been able to clear enmity off the islands I've raided with leftover reputation tokens. Now after 6 games, I look at the board and glaring back are the unfriendly stickers my past aggressions have littered upon the sea.

| | Dave | Joe | Kyle | Mike | Scott | islands | Total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Dave** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | **3** |
| **Joe** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| **Kyle** | 3 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | **13** |
| **Mike** | 0 | 1 | 6 | 0 | 1 | 0 | **8** |
| **Scott** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |

My total permanent enmity dwarves my fellow players. Mike is the only exception, but, when considering 6 of his enmity reside in my port, it is clear his number is inflated by a single (terrible for me) raid that took place in game 2 and is not the result from sustained raiding, aka pirate-life.

I am making this assessment to point out that my pirating days must, by necessity, come to an end. I am at a disadvantage against every player and this only figures to get worse if I am able to capture pole position.

My strategy for the next game is to establish a colony, and then, depending on the number of rounds left in a game, I will either establish a second colony or explore The Sarcophagus Room or The Chasm of Echoes.

# Game 14
This is an all or nothing game plan. If I do not find the final island, I will have passed on enough glory through opportunity cost that I'll likely have lost the overall game.

## Playbook
The keys to my game:
1. Find another chart to the last island.
1. Discover the final island.
1. I've got 2 helpful research cards. A chart that adds 2 successes to an empty sea space exploration and a chart that let's me re-roll on an empty sea space. I actually have a half dozen land charts, but those won't help.
1. Operation Indiana Jones

### SeaFall Master Plan
* I need 2 high impact raid advisors
* **Advisor Watchlist** (67% chance of appearing on the winter flop)
  1. The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel (13g)
  1. The Builder's Patron (7g, 2r)
  1. The Gatherer of Brethren (7g)
  1. The Walker of Paths (7g)
* **Secondary Advisor Watchlist** (if none of the above are available... >73% chance of finding primary or secondary advisor on the winter flop)
  1. The Acolyte
  1. The Bosun (3g, 1r)
  1. The Cannoneer (4g, 1r)
  1. High cost Merchants and Explorers
    * The Court Wizard (12g)
    * The Master Smuggler (12g)
    * The Merchant's Patron (6g, 2r)
    * The Noble (5g, 2r)
  1. The Pirate (5g, 2r)
  1. Rodger? The highest explore advisor.
  1. The Savage (3g, 1r)
  1. The Seeker of Answers (7g)

#### First Winter
* I am a co-leader, so I get 0 bonuses.
* Starting gold is 12g (home province fields) + 3g (rubble fields)
* Activate Taxachusetts -6g
* 3g (rubble), wood (Taxachusetts)
* Place relic on Amazon Prime Now.
* **12 gold, 2 glory**

#### Turn 1
* Keep eye out for key advisors. If there is an upgrade advisor that can be interrogate, recruit them with reputation.
* Upgrade Adamantium with Endurance -10g
* Build the Guild Hall in Taxachusetts -2g and wood
* **0 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* Keep eye out for key advisors.
* Activate Master Thief advisor
* Sail to Windy
* Tax with the Master Thief (+3g base, +2g advisor, +4g colony = 9g)
* **9g gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 3
* Keep eye out for key advisors.
* Sail to Japan
* Raid the yellow dock and take +1 explore upgrade. (This might be worth doing anyways since it is an extra upgrade that can be exhausted)
* **9 gold, 6 glory**

#### Turn 4+
* Operate out of Arados looking for key advisors with Guild Hall.
* Interrogate
* Tax if low on coin
* Explore the tomb if coin level is good.
* If anyone gets surly, sink a ship. I think a lot of us will be hanging out at Arados.

##### Operation Indiana Jones
* Should the opportunity present itself, there is a cute advisor called The Acolyte that gives +2 dice to an endeavor for every relic on the flagship. Dave has 4 relics. I have a hold of 6 and 1 relic. If Dave happens to be in Arados while I'm chilling there, I could potentially steal his relics and then bolt to the deep part of the ocean on the same turn! I should also consider chasing Dave down early in the game if he splits his ships up for any particular reason. In the last game he split his relics between his two ships. One of his relics also adds an extra success to each strong success for explore endeavors. I might only be able to get a couple relics off him, but who knows...

##### The Rodger
* The advisor has the highest explore bonus. I might have to steal them with The Seeker of Answers.

#### Second Winter
* 12g (home province fields) + 3g (rubble fields) + 3g (taxa fields)
* Activate Kites -6g
* 3g (rubble), 3g (kites), wood (Taxachusetts)
* In total +18g

### Reeling in the big one
* The challenge of discovering the last island is a dangerous 30.
* I have one chart that is worth 2 successes (30 - 2 = 28)
* Presume I can acquire the 2 known last island charts (28 - 10 = 18)
* Presume I have Enduring upgrade that reduces damage by 1 in the following scenarios.
* I only need to survive, so I'm willing to take at least 2 damage cards and exhaust both upgrades. (18 - 4 = 14)
  * What if I'm willing to take 3 damage cards that carries a 23.2% chance of sinking?
* Consider if I can find 3 last island charts (14 - 5 = 9)
* My explore will be 3 base + 1 support + 1 upgrade (5 explore), so an advisor will have to make up the difference.

#### Last island as 14 success threshold (plus 1, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 15 gives a 58% chance of success.
  * Only The Acolyte and having 5 relics would make this possible.
* A dice pool of 13 gives a 28% chance of success.
  * If willing to take 3 damage cards, then 34% of success.
  * As an act of desperation I could use Rodger in this scenario.

#### Last island as 14 success threshold (plus 2, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 12 gives a 53% chance of success.
  * The Acolyte with 3 relics, including Dave's explore relic. Intriguing... if the game is looking close to ending and I haven't found the 3rd chart, then this could be a go for broke situation if I can seek out Dave ships. If the opportunity presents itself early, perhaps I should pounce, too.

#### Last island as 9 success threshold (plus 1, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 9 gives a 52% chance of success.
* A dice pool of 10 gives a 71% chance of success!
  * I'll have to look at what advisors we have, but there may be several with +4 explore or more

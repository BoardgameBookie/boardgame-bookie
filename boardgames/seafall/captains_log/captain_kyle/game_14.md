# Game 14
This is an all or nothing game plan. If I do not find the final island, I will have passed on enough glory through opportunity cost that I'll likely have lost the overall game.

## Playbook
The keys to my game:
1. Find another chart to the end of the world. This will be very challenging since there are so many potential advisors.
1. Discover the island at the end of the world.
1. I've got 2 helpful research cards. A chart that adds 2 successes to an empty sea space exploration and a chart that let's me re-roll on an empty sea space. I actually have a half dozen land charts, but those won't help.
1. Operation Indiana Jones
1. If the path to the end of the world should be closed off, then build a colony if possible.

### SeaFall Master Plan

* **Advisor Watchlist**
  1. The Acolyte
  1. ^The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel (13g)
  1. ^The Builder's Patron (7g, 2r)

#### First Winter
* I am a co-leader, so I get 0 bonuses.
* Starting gold is 12g (home province fields) + 3g (rubble fields)
* Activate Taxachusetts -6g
* 3g (rubble), wood (Taxachusetts)
* Place relic on Amazon Prime Now.
* **12 gold, 2 glory**

#### Turn 1
* Keep eye out for key advisors. If there is an upgrade advisor that can be interrogated, recruit them with reputation.
* Upgrade Amazon Prime Now with Endurance -10g
* Build the Guild Hall in Taxachusetts -2g and wood
* **0 gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 2
* Keep eye out for key advisors.
* Activate Master Thief advisor
* Sail to Windy
* Tax with the Master Thief (+3g base, +2g advisor, +4g colony = 9g)
* **9g gold, 4 glory**

#### Turn 3
* Keep eye out for key advisors.
* Sail to Japan
* Raid the yellow dock and take +1 explore upgrade.
* **9 gold, 6 glory**

#### Turn 4
* Keep eye out for key advisors.
* Raid the Mine in Japan (6g)
* Tax (+3g base, +4g colony = 7g)
* **21 gold, 7 glory**

#### Turn 5
* Keep eye out for key advisors
* Sail to Arados
* Tax
* **28 gold, 7 glory**

#### Turn 6+
* Operate out of Arados looking for key advisors with Guild Hall.
* Interrogate
* Tax if low on coin
* Explore the tomb if coin level is good.

##### Operation Indiana Jones
* Should the opportunity present itself, there is a cute advisor called The Acolyte that gives +2 dice to an endeavor for every relic on the flagship. Dave has 4 relics. I have a hold of 6 and 1 relic. If Dave happens to be in Arados while I'm chilling there, I could potentially steal his relics and then bolt to the deep part of the ocean on the same turn! I should also consider chasing Dave down early in the game if he splits his ships up for any particular reason. In the last game he split his relics between his two ships. One of his relics also adds an extra success to each strong success for explore endeavors. I might only be able to get a couple relics off him, but who knows...

##### The Rodger
* The advisor has the highest explore bonus. I might have to steal them with The Seeker of Answers.

#### Second Winter
* 12g (home province fields) + 3g (rubble fields) + 3g (taxa fields)
* Activate Kites -6g
* 3g (rubble), 3g (kites), wood (Taxachusetts)
* In total +18g

### Reeling in the big one
* The challenge of discovering the end of the world is a dangerous 30.
* I have one chart that is worth 2 successes (30 - 2 = 28)
* Presume I can acquire the 2 known end of the world charts (28 - 10 = 18)
* Presume I have Enduring upgrade that reduces damage by 1 in the following scenarios.
* I only need to survive, so I'm willing to take at least 2 damage cards and exhaust both upgrades. (18 - 4 = 14)
  * What if I'm willing to take 3 damage cards that carries a 23.2% chance of sinking?
* Consider if I can find 3 end of the world charts (14 - 5 = 9)
* My explore will be 3 base + 1 support + 1 upgrade (5 explore), so an advisor will have to make up the difference.

#### end of the world as 14 success threshold (plus 1, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 15 gives a 58% chance of success.
  * Only The Acolyte and having 5 relics would make this possible.
* A dice pool of 13 gives a 28% chance of success.
  * If willing to take 3 damage cards, then 34% of success.
  * As an act of desperation I could use Rodger in this scenario.

#### end of the world as 14 success threshold (plus 2, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 12 gives a 53% chance of success.
  * The Acolyte with 3 relics, including Dave's explore relic. Intriguing... if the game is looking close to ending and I haven't found the 3rd chart, then this could be a go for broke situation if I can seek out Dave's ships. If the opportunity presents itself early, perhaps I should pounce, too.

#### end of the world as 9 success threshold (plus 1, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 9 gives a 52% chance of success.
* A dice pool of 10 gives a 71% chance of success!
  * I'll have to look at what advisors we have, but there may be several with +4 explore or more


### Re-thinking the plan.
* I cannot count on finding a 3rd chart to the end of the world.
* The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel is very expensive.
  * At some point I'll have to use the Bloodthirsty Scoundrel to retrieve enmity
* If I am able to claim a good number of relics, then consider recovering a lost relic through an Arados advisor.

#### Turn 1
* Keep eye out for key advisors.
* Sail to Windy
* Build the Guild Hall in Taxachusetts -2g and wood

  * Only attack the ships with The Cannoneer or The Pirate

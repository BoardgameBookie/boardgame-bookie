# Game 14
This is an all or nothing game plan. If I do not find the island at the end of the world, I'll likely miss my chance to win the overall game. I will have passed on enough glory via opportunity costs in game 14, Mike will have more games to find the secrets of the statues, and everyone else might start focusing their efforts on finding the final island, too.

## Playbook
The keys to my game:
1. Obtain the two known advisors with knowledge of the island at the end of the world.
1. Build The Temple.
1. Discover the island at the end of the world.
1. I've got 2 helpful research cards. A chart that adds 2 successes to an empty sea space exploration and a chart that let's me re-roll on an empty sea space. I actually have a half dozen land charts, but those won't help.
1. If the path to the end of the world should be closed off, then build a colony if possible.

### Reeling in the big one
* The challenge of discovering the end of the world is a dangerous 30.
* I have one chart that is worth 2 successes (30 - 2 = 28)
* Presume I can acquire the 2 known end of the world charts (28 - 10 = 18)
* Presume I have the built The Temple that adds 9 to any explore endeavor (18 - 9 = 9)
* Presume I have Enduring upgrade that reduces damage by 1 in the following scenarios.
* I only need to survive, so I'm willing to take at least 2 damage cards and exhaust both upgrades. (9 - 4 = 5)
* My explore will be 3 base + 1 support + 1 upgrade (5 explore), so an advisor will have to make up the difference.

#### end of the world as 5 success threshold (plus 1, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 15 gives a 58% chance of success.
  * Only The Acolyte and having 5 relics would make this possible.
* A dice pool of 13 gives a 28% chance of success.
  * If willing to take 3 damage cards, then 34% of success.
  * As an act of desperation I could use Rodger in this scenario.

#### end of the world as 6 success threshold (re-roll)
* If the game is going to end on turn 7, don't upgrade the ship again. Just bolt to the end of the world and roll the dice.
* A dice pool of 15 gives a 58% chance of success.
  * Only The Acolyte and having 5 relics would make this possible.
* A dice pool of 13 gives a 28% chance of success.
  * If willing to take 3 damage cards, then 34% of success.
  * As an act of desperation I could use Rodger in this scenario.

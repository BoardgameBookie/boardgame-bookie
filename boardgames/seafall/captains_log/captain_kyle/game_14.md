# Game 14
This is an all or nothing game plan. If I do not find the island at the end of the world, I'll likely miss my chance to win the overall game. I will have passed on enough glory via opportunity costs in game 14, Mike will have more games to find the secrets of the statues, and everyone else might start focusing their efforts on finding the final island, too.

## Playbook
The keys to my game:
1. Find another chart to the end of the world. This will be very challenging since there are so many potential advisors.
1. Discover the island at the end of the world.
1. I've got 2 helpful research cards. A chart that adds 2 successes to an empty sea space exploration and a chart that let's me re-roll on an empty sea space. I actually have a half dozen land charts, but those won't help.
1. Operation Indiana Jones
1. If the path to the end of the world should be closed off, then build a colony if possible.

### Operation Indiana Jones
* There is a cute advisor called The Acolyte that gives +2 dice to an endeavor for every relic on the flagship. Dave has 4 relics. I have a hold of 6 and 1 relic. If Dave happens to be in Arados while I'm chilling there, I could potentially steal his relics and then bolt to the deep part of the ocean on the same turn! I should also consider chasing Dave down early in the game. Dave always keeps his two ships together, but in the last game he split his relics between his two ships. I might only be able to get a couple relics off him, but who knows...

In addition to powering the Acolyte, some of the relics would directly aid in the discovery of the island at the end of the world.  One of Dave's relics adds an extra success to each strong success rolled for explore endeavors. Another relic allows unlimited fortune tokens to be used at dangerous sites (if I raid Dave early and get this relic, then I should go for Bold instead of Cunning and try to get extra fortune tokens from the Grizzle Veteran).

#### The Rodger
* The advisor has the highest explore bonus. I might have to steal them with The Seeker of Answers.

### Reeling in the big one
* The challenge of discovering the end of the world is a dangerous 30.
* I have one chart that is worth 2 successes (30 - 2 = 28)
* Presume I can acquire the 2 known end of the world charts (28 - 10 = 18)
* Presume I have Enduring upgrade that reduces damage by 1 in the following scenarios.
* I only need to survive, so I'm willing to take at least 2 damage cards and exhaust both upgrades. (18 - 4 = 14)
  * What if I'm willing to take 3 damage cards that carries a 23.2% chance of sinking?
* Consider if I can find 3 end of the world charts (14 - 5 = 9)
* My explore will be 3 base + 1 support + 1 upgrade (5 explore), so an advisor will have to make up the difference.

#### end of the world as 14 success threshold (plus 1, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 15 gives a 58% chance of success.
  * Only The Acolyte and having 5 relics would make this possible.
* A dice pool of 13 gives a 28% chance of success.
  * If willing to take 3 damage cards, then 34% of success.
  * As an act of desperation I could use Rodger in this scenario.

#### end of the world as 14 success threshold (plus 2, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 12 gives a 53% chance of success.
  * The Acolyte with 3 relics, including Dave's explore relic. Intriguing... if the game is looking close to ending and I haven't found the 3rd chart, then this could be a go for broke situation if I can seek out Dave's ships. If the opportunity presents itself early, perhaps I should pounce, too.

#### end of the world as 9 success threshold (plus 1, re-roll)
* A dice pool of 9 gives a 52% chance of success.
* A dice pool of 10 gives a 71% chance of success!
  * I'll have to look at what advisors we have, but there may be several with +4 explore or more


### Re-thinking the plan.
* I cannot count on finding a 3rd chart to the end of the world.

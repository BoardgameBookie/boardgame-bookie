# Game 6

## Playbook

The colony box included 5 new milestones. 3 of the 5 are colony based and, given the cost of building colonies, will likely be around for several games before they are claimed. The remaining 2 are all merchant based: collect 30+ gold by selling goods in a single turn, and have 60+ gold in your vault at the end of a turn. These 2 milestones are the one's I will set my sights on; I believe the collect 30+ gold in single turn will be the first to go.

Unfortunately, I had not kept the advisor that I had stolen from Joe in the previous game, "The Donald". With his advisor ability (+2-sell and +2 to gold for good sold) and my appellation, I would have been able to claim the 30+ milestone on my second turn! I kept a raid advisor instead. This meant I had to keep an eye out for an advisor that gives a sell bonus.

To make an informed strategy I enumerated the advisors and tabulated the following:

| Advisor Origin | Builders | Explorers | Merchants (+sell) | Soldiers |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Starter | 5 | 5 | 5 (3)| 5 |
| Dangerous Waters | 3 | 5 | 2 (1) | 6 |
| Tombs | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| Colonies | 6 | 0 | 10 (8) | 0 |
| **Total** | **14** | **16** | **17 (12)** | **11** |

After some math (see Jupyter notebook Advisor Probabilities), we know there is a 70% chance the advisor forum opens with a +sell advisor that is necessary to reach the 30+ milestone. Afterwards, there is roughly a 20% chance a +sell advisor is drawn from the top of the deck afterwards. Playing 4th meant there was approx. an 85% chance that I would see at least one +sell advisor by my turn, though another player could hire this advisor(s) before my turn. Despite not starting with a +sell Merchants Guild advisor, I felt comfortable with odds I'd hire one when it was time to sell and claim the 30+ milestone.

Dave has a sizable lead on the rest of us. After accounting for my starting bonus I will begin with 16 coin! My first priority will be acquiring a Trading Post and an advisor with +sell. My primary goal is to claim the 30+ milestone.

1. I'll buy 2 goods, 1 being a linen, at Prussia. (16 to 10)
1. Raid, activating the kept advisor, the dock at Prussia, claim the Deadly upgrade, and collect taxes. (10 to 15)
1. Sail home and build a Trading Post. (15 to 5)
1. Pay appellation fee, Sell, Sail, Buy 2 goods (5 to 7). Split up the ships, so I can Sell, Sail, and Buy on every turn.
1. Hopefully activate Merchants Guild advisor. Pay appellation fee, Buy 1 good, Sail, Sell 3. Collect the Markets Tremble milestone. (7 to 32)
1. Pay appellation fee, Buy 2 (at an island with enmity), Sail, Sell 2. (32 to 42)
1. Collect 10 coin from fields during Winter. Check to see if I can buy a 10 gold treasure. Pay appellation fee, Buy 3, Sail, Sell 3. Claim 60+ milestone. (42 to 61)
1. Buy a giant treasure. Try to steal Scott's tablet or raid the dock at Snake in Boots island to try and end the game.  

## Play-by-play

The game started with The Renowned Merchant in the forum. Everyone agreed the 30+ milestone was the easiest to reach, so I thought this advisor would be off the board before it became my turn. However, I was surprised when this did not happen and happily hired Ivanka without a second thought. I bought my goods.

On my second turn, I payed two reputation for The Surveyor, who is useful for founding colonies; I thought I might want him to keep at the end of the game. I then raided the docks in Prussia and taxed. I was following my playbook, but in actuality I made an error in doing so. I did not anticipate getting an advisor I needed on the first turn. Upon reflecting on my second turn I would have been better off raiding a site to claim a third good. If I had done this, then I could have claimed the 30+ milestone on turn 4 instead of turn 5 (note that I'd have needed to split up my ships on Turn 3, before building the Trading Post).

This unforced error almost doomed me. The lesson is don't blindly follow the playbook; assess each turn whether or not the playbook needs to the tweaked.

On my third turn, another advisor with +sell was in the forum; this advisor lowered the cost of buying a good by 1. I hired this advisor mostly as a defensive move to prevent others from being able to claim the 30+ milestone. However, after this advisor was replaced in the forum my jaw dropped to the floor. On the top of the advisor deck was none other than The Donald, the one, and only, advisor that threatened to ruin my chances to claim the 30+ milestone.

Dave recognized this immediately. He too was going for the 30+ milestone, and hired The Donald. Remarkably, and unexpectedly, Dave was in line to claim the 30+ milestone on the next turn, 1 turn before I could. My carefully laid plans were thwarted. I thought carefully if I could possibly reach the milestone in turn 4 instead of turn 5. This is when I realized I had made the unforced error I referenced earlier. I felt some regret about this missed opportunity.

Fortunately, though I couldn't claim the milestone before Dave's turn, I could stop him from claiming it for himself. I was able to hire a +2-raid advisor that turn, and then sent the Deadly Adamantium to Dave's harbor and my swift boat to Windy (to make a goods purchase on the next turn). My raid on the docks wasn't entirely irredeemable. I then cast my dice pool of 7 against Dave's warehouse. I rolled 4 successes. I claimed a good, dropped 3 enmity tokens, and then took a curse card. The curse did not affect my play. Perfect!

At this point I left the room. Dave was stunned and spent what felt like 20 minutes trying to figure out how to retaliate, which was agonizing. Dave forgot about the At-War-With enmity bonus and I wasn't about to remind him. In the end he conceded, because the "garrison" on my ships was too great. With the enmity, however, Dave would have been able to steal his good back. Mike looked my way wondering if he should clarify the rule for Dave, but thankfully Mike did me a favor and did not say anything.

Looking back, I made an unforced error during this turn, too. The correct move would have been to raid Dave's council room and dismiss the key advisor, The Donald; My other ship sailed to an island ready to make a goods purchase on the next turn, and I would have been able to buy 2 goods with the advisor that lowered the cost of goods by 1 (I already had a good at my home port). Had I done this I wouldn't have created this nail-biting moment where I was counting on Dave to make a mistake. Sheesh!

Despite all this drama and two unforced errors I managed to claim the 30+ milestone. I got a field upgrade and no one was happy for me.

I was now setup to also claim the 60+ coin milestone in 2 turns, which I did. Notably, Joe was 4 gold away from claiming this the turn before me after discovering 40 gold in a tomb, so it was another close call. This milestone was more meaningful in the end, because I was able to claim the **Sell 3** leader upgrade that I had been coveting since I noticed it on the upgrade sticker sheet. The Sell-3 is a big deal, especially in combination with my Prosperous appellation.

After thwarting Dave and dodging a bullet, Dave had zero glory. I point this out only because Dave ended the game by collecting 14 glory in 4 turns and even left another 2 glory behind due to an unforced error. Dave has a crazy one-turn glory grab where he can build a structure that gives him 7 glory: 2 glory for each of his 3 relics. As a group we'll have to decide if buying this structure before Dave is a strategy worth pursuing to try and slow him down. I think Dave would have been more upset about my attack had he not ended the game with such momentum.

Scott ended up winning the game with 20 points, scoring glory on an impressive run of exploration. He successfully explored 2 tombs and discovered 2 islands. To do all that in 8 turns is no small feat. The exploration mechanic is still extremely powerful, despite it being the primary source of glory for everyone (except me). Will exploration be an endless source of glory? Can it ever be exhausted? Does the game end when there is nothing left to explore? Time will tell.

The biggest takeaway for me is that I need to be more thoughtful in-game and avoid unforced errors. I felt like I had a sloppy game. In spite of my misfortune that Dave (so lucky!) would top-deck The Donald and having two egregious unforced errors, I was extremely fortunate to accomplish everything I set out to do. It was a roller coaster of a game.

# Game 3

## Playbook

After making unforced errors that prevented me from winning game 2 and missing out on cool milestones, I studied the rules of SeaFall at great length and decided to map out the first several turns. I was going to pursue a merchant strategy again and had retained The Renowned Merchant from the previous round.

I added more sail to my swift boat, so it had a range of 5 and my big boat had a range of 2. My plan was to minimize the sailing I did, so that I could buy and sell goods on the same turn. My big boat would buy goods from the first island and my swift boat would head out to the far away islands. Every third turn I could perform a buy and sell action on the same turn.

## Play-by-play

I liked the efficiency of my strategy, but I failed to account for an important detail. The enmity sticker I had placed on the closest island made goods cost 1 more, which completely thwarted my plans. I could no longer buy the marketplace to really become a powerful merchant. I totally forgot about enmity while creating my strategy, and a sinking feeling came over me when during my first turn that my whole strategy had to be thrown out the window.

Unwisely, I tried to pursue something that resembled my merchant strategy, but it just was not working. The merchant strategy is a losing strategy if you cannot get the economic engine running. Halfway through the game I decided I should go after the sink-a-ship milestone, so I bulked up the attack on my big ship. However, I did do the math on how difficult it is to sink a ship. By the time I adopted this strategy most everyone had ship upgrades and even with an attack advisor I couldn't sink anybody. Several turns of investment to upgrade raid proved to be wasteful.

In the meantime, everyone else was still heavily pushing the exploration strategy. Several islands were discovered. Most impressive was Joe who during his last turn collected 9 glory and blew away the competition. This glory was a combination of reaching a milestone and a 4 glory reward from exploring a tomb.

Despite the unforced errors from game 2, I somehow managed to do even worse in game 3 by forgetting another important rule regarding the cost of goods and enmity; I realized that I shouldn't raid from the same islands I plan to buy goods from later. Then I failed to recognize the difficulty in sinking a ship.

I learned that I cannot so blindly follow a single strategy. The exploration mechanic is more powerful than ever, because ancient tombs are bring discovered and explored. Also, discovering a new island brings a lot of glory. Even if I become a great merchant I'll need to pick my spots exploring. Finding islands and searching tombs are good bets for big rewards.

After all the glory was totaled I ended up in last place overall! I felt pretty miserable about this and wanted to play the next game right away to try and improve my position. Thinking ahead to pursuing the sink-a-ship milestone for the next game I upgraded the raid on my big ship. Thinking it might be premature to pursue the merchant strategy without better "tools" I retained The Renowned Builder instead of the merchant.

# Game 1

## Playbook

I wanted to continue exploring, because this worked well in the prologue.

## Play-by-play

I did not get to explore as much as I wanted. Everyone else was focused on exploring, too. Since I won the prologue I went last and therefore had the worst options with respect to the available sites for exploration. I also was left choosing the least wanted advisor (during this game we did not replenish the advisors due to a misunderstanding of the rules, so I was left with no choice).

Notably, I did not understand how to correctly approach milestones coming into the game. Milestones give glory and legacy upgrades, so they are very powerful. To reach a milestone a concerted effort must be made; the right advisor must be played and some luck in timing/player-order is also key. This all became clear as I enviously watched others reach milestones.

Dave in particular had a strong winning round. Key to his victory was purchasing treasures and reaching a treasure milestone that grants him an extra glory whenever he has a treasure in the treasure room.

# Game 1

## Playbook

I wanted to continue exploring, because this worked well in the prologue.

## Play-by-play

I did not get to explore as much as I wanted. Everyone else was focused on exploring, too. Since I won the prologue I went last and therefore had the worst options with respect to sites to explore. I also was left choosing the least wanted advisor.

Importantly, I did not understand how to correctly approach milestones. Milestones give glory and legacy upgrades, so they are very powerful. To reach a milestone a concerted effort must be made, the right advisor must be played, and some luck in timing/player-order is also key. This all became clear as I saw others reach milestones with envy.

Dave in particular had a strong winning round. Key to his victory was purchasing treasures and reaching a treasure milestone that grants him an extra glory whenever he has a treasure in the treasure room.

# Game 14
This is an all or nothing game plan. If I do not find the island at the end of the world, I'll likely miss my chance to win the overall game. I will have passed on enough glory via opportunity costs in game 14, Mike will have likely found at least one of the secrets to the statues, and the whole group might start focusing their efforts on finding the final island, too.

## Playbook
The keys to my game:
1. Obtain the two known advisors with knowledge of the island at the end of the world.
1. Build The Temple.
1. Discover the island at the end of the world.
1. I've got 2 helpful research cards. A chart that adds 2 successes to an empty sea space exploration and a chart that let's me re-roll on an empty sea space. I actually have a half dozen land charts, but those won't help.
1. If the path to the end of the world should be closed off, then build a colony if possible.

  * Only pursue this path if you have Rodger. The stakes are so high I would not even consider this option unless I can find a +7 explore advisor, and only The Renowned Explorer, Rodger, is this powerful. Joe might have held onto this advisor from the previous game.

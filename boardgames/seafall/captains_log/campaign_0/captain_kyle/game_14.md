# Game 14
This is an all or nothing game plan. If I do not find the island at the end of the world, I'll likely miss my chance to win the overall game. I will have passed on enough glory via opportunity costs in game 14, Mike will have likely found at least one of the secrets to the statues, and the whole group might start focusing their efforts on finding the final island, too.

***Don't forget to take the reputation sticker as the reward for winning the last game; the game got packed up so fast I didn't have the chance to add it.***

## Play-by-play

What a thrilling ending to SeaFall! I am the newly crowned *EMPEROR!* It was a wild finish that could easily have gone to Mike (and probably should have gone to Mike), but the stars aligned for me and lit a path to the End of the World.

I agonized over my game plan for this game knowing this was my best and last chance to claim campaign victory. My plan boiled down to finding the advisors who knew the way to the End of the World and building The Temple; I'm certain this is the most common recipe for reaching this final milestone, but I had a couple advantages. First, I had found two of the four map advisors the previous game and wrote down their names; not everybody did. Also, The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel, one of the two known map advisors, was a Patmos advisor and I owned the Patmos colony (so I didn't have to travel their to hire this advisor). Second, I had The Wise appellation that allowed me to purchase two advisors each turn. Combined with the Guild Hall I was able to mill the advisor deck for the exact advisors I needed. Our interpretation of the Guild Hall and The Wise was that I could use the Guild Hall before hiring each advisor (essentially meaning I could use the Guild Hall twice). This is a broader interpretation of the rules than seems to be the consensus on BGG, but I think this makes the game more fun (acknowledging my bias!). Third, I had a powerful raid ship that I could use to earn gold and raid mines. This was especially powerful when combined with the Tax+4 colony that I also owned. In summary, I had the means to find the essential advisors and raise funds for purchasing The Temple. It all looked good on paper, but I made a strategic error before the game even began.

In my original plan, I emphasized recruiting advisors ahead of building The Temple. I was weighing the likelihood of missing out on The Temple versus the likelihood of missing out on a map advisor. I had a hunch that Joe and Mike, in particular, would be too distracted collecting tablets and reaching statue milestones to realize the urgency to build The Temple. I also felt it was much easier to happen upon a map advisor through good fortune in the advisor forum than collecting the resources necessary for building The Temple. Unfortunately, I did not appreciate the fact that there is only a single Temple that by itself was worth very nearly the two map advisors combined. I also misread Mike's strategy; he recognized game 14 was the game to go for broke and was set on building The Temple as fast as possible.

The outcome of this game came down to the building of The Temple, which I did by a near miraculous circumstance! Mike had a nifty approach to collecting 40 gold in 3 turns setting himself up to build the temple by turn 4. My original plan had me hiring both map advisors first before building Temple on turn 5. Mike was going to beat me to The Temple and I didn't see it coming. Mike's plan was brilliant!
* turn 1, buy 4 goods with 12 gold he started with and a +buy advisor and then activate his tablet that gives him 12 gold whenever his vault his zero. In one turn he equivalently had received 4 free goods!
   * Note that he had another tablet that activated a colony for free, from which he claimed 1 good before the game. He has control of 5 total goods.
* turn 2, one of the goods he purchased was a linen. He then built the 18g Marketplace building that gives him +4g for selling goods.
* turn 3, sell 4 goods for 10g each using a +sell advisor to reach the 40g threshold for building The Temple.
* turn 4, build The Temple... except this plan didn't account for what I was able to pull off.

The start to my game could not have been better.
* turn 1, build the Guild Hall in Taxachusetts as planned and sail to Windy.
* turn 2, raid the 8-mine in Windy and Tax with the Master Thief. There is one key detail to my second turn: the event for this season was a Soldier's Guild festival that granted +3g to taxes. I cleaned up with a tidy 20g!
* turn 3, Guild Hall through the advisor deck and claim The Builder's Patron and The Bloodthirsty Scoundrel (13g cost for me!). I was ready to spend some serious coin to do this, but remarkably I only spent 5g to accomplish this feat. There was some good karma in play here, too, because I had let Mike and Joe use the Guild Hall for themselves (for the 1 reputation token fee of course) on their previous turns. Their milling of the advisor deck saved me some gold! For my actions I activated the Bloodthirsty Scoundrel and raided the 8-mine in Candyland. At the end of my turn I had the two map advisors we knew about heading into the game and 22g.
   * while I got lucky with the Soldier's Guild festival on turn 2, I got very unlucky with the event on turn 3. Having hired the Builder's Patron I had the highest ranking builder. The event said the player with the highest ranking builder had to destroy all of the buildings at their colonies. Sadly, I would lose the Guild Hall and with it my Tax+4 bonus and 1 glory. The silver lining was that I had found the important advisors I needed that very turn.

A hold my breath moment occurred on Dave's third turn when he decided to raid my province and he rocked his roll. He could have claimed anything in my province and he decided it came down to either taking my tablet or half my gold. My plans would have been shot had he taken my gold; I had to keep my lips pursed while he deliberated, but thankfully the allure of the tablets swayed him and he spared my gold; had he taken my gold he would have ended my game. Despite this close call, everything was going according to plan! And yet, my third turn took place before Mike's, so I did not realize the trouble I was in until I saw 40g land in Mike's vault. I was too far away from his province to raid his vault. The optimism I felt just moments prior quickly dissolved into a silent panic. Was this how it would all end?

For the record, had I emphasized building The Temple before anything else, I could have built The Temple on turn 4, Dave's raid aside. Had I skipped hiring the Bloodthirsty Scoundrel I would have also had 40g at the end of turn 3. I also could have milled for a decent build advisor to seal the deal. Now knowing what Mike had planned I see it was foolish of me to assume that no one else thought to race towards The Temple, especially a player as shrewd as Mike.

In spite of my arrogance, Lady Luck was on my side. As my fourth turn was approaching I was flummoxed. I didn't know what to do. That is until Scott, taking his turn before mine hired an advisor from the forum. I looked intently at who would be available for hire on my turn and lo and behold it was THE ONLY ADVISOR IN THE DECK CAPABLE OF PULLING OFF THE IMPOSSIBLE: THE CONTRACTOR!!! He was mine for the taking and was the missing jigsaw piece to my puzzle. The Contractor's power granted me a free good from the supply, a spice, and had been upgraded to a -10 build. I had 22 gold in my vault. To the coin I had just enough gold to build The Temple. Mike was aghast! I could not believe my good fortune.

This essentially swung the game, and the whole campaign, in my favor. The rest of the game required me to bolster my flagship for the ultimate exploration. There were some interesting decisions left to make, but nothing compares to me top-decking The Contractor; those must have been some incredible odds. After telling my wife, she said it was like hitting on 17 in blackjack and being dealt a 4.
* turn 4: build Temple, sail to Japan.
* turn 5: I was planning on raiding the yellow dock, but Dave beat me to it. This thwarted my original plan, so I sailed on to Hangry, raided the brown dock, and took the Enduring upgrade (+1 to strong successes).
* turn 6: I had exhausted all of my resources. I had no gold. I had 1 reputation left from the 7 I started with and 2 fortune tokens. There wasn't a clear choice to make, because I couldn't reach a yellow dock to raid. However, conveniently, I was in last place by a single glory. With the year about to end there was actually an incentive to do nothing and become the first player at the start of the second year. This would prove essential to my victory. I sailed back to Japan and taxed for 3g.
* turn 7: With the yellow dock available again I purchased the Cunning upgrade and built a Gun Tower in Kites (recently activated) for 2 additional glory.

At this juncture I had done everything conceivable to put myself in position to discover the Island at the End of the World. All I needed was one more turn. I couldn't concentrate. I had to leave the room. Dave was 5 glory away from triggering the game end I was worried he would pull it off; fatefully, there wasn't a big glory grab available to him and he built a single structure. The was then set, I would have my 8th turn.
* turn 8: sail to the end of the world and attempt an explore endeavor. I had everyone gather around me and check my math:
   * Dangerous 30 starting defense
   * A chart worth 2 successes, 30 - 2 = 28
   * The two map advisors, 28 - 10 = 18
   * The Temple, 18 - 9 = 9

  I also hired The Helmsman on this turn to give me +4 explore to go along with +3 flagship explore and +1 support ship. I was rolling 8 dice against a dangerous 9, but my two ship upgrades would help. I could spend two fortune tokens and my strong successes counted as +1. I had a great roll: 5 successes, 1 strong success, 2 blanks. I used my two fortune tokens and avoided taking a single damage. I discovered The End of the World in style!

For my efforts I was rewarded handsomely with glory, and perhaps the greatest benefit was that the game ended immediately. I got to take one more turn than anybody else and that was clearly reflected in the final glory totals; Mike said he had plans to collect 10 glory in a single turn by buying a big treasure and discovery a secret of the statues (we found out the eroded tablet would never lead to a secret of the statues earlier this game, so Mike felt pretty confident).

Wow! So many things had to go right for me to win this game. It starts with the unbelievable timing of The Contractor appearing in the forum. Yet other moments also proved essential: Dave raided my treasure room instead of my vault; The seasonal event gave me +3g; I only needed to use the Guild Hall once with 5g to find the two map advisors; I had the least amount of glory going into the second winter, because another seasonal event destroyed my Guild Hall. In the end, I was able to collect almost everything I set out to collect according to my pre-game plan, but the journey I took to get there had some amazing re-directs and unexpected twists; I love SeaFall for setting a stage where such drama takes place. I know I'm biased, because I won the campaign, yet, I still have to say, this was one of the best gaming experiences of my life.

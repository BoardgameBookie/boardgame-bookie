# Game 2

## Playbook

I still did not have a formal plan, but I had the sense that I should shift away from the exploration mechanic, since everyone else seemed to be pursuing this strategy. For the ship upgrades I chose to increase the sail on a ship. Everyone else increased exploration.

## Play-by-play

I did not have a good performance in game 1 so I got to start earlier in the game. I was fortunate to collect The Renowned Merchant advisor, so I decided to give the merchant strategy a shot. I quite like this strategy, because it has an engine building aspect to it that I like. Having the fastest boat also meant I could reach goods faster than others and get first choice.

I bought goods and mixed in two raids for a good. I was focused on making money. I built the marketplace and through the renowned merchant I made 24 gold in a single turn. I started buying treasures as the game continued on and, near the end, I was in pole position and set to win during my next turn.

However, disaster struck in the form of Mike, who attacked my treasure room before my turn came. It was a bold move. He hadn't checked the math, but when we calculated the probability of success it was only %35. By stealing a 2 glory treasure I dropped down the leader board and Mike was propelled to victory. I didn't think Mike would attack, so I felt somewhat humiliated being on the losing end of an epic move.

Adding salt to the wound, Mike had also beat me to acquiring a milestone I was gunning for earlier to build 3 structures. Worse, it was entirely my fault, because I forgot about a fundamental game rule. I forgot that fields give money during the winter phase. I was planning a few turns at a time to synchronize my buying and selling. Mike and I both had two structures and I thought he wasn't able to afford another structure, except that he actually could after collecting 8 gold during the winter phase. This outcome more than any other motivated me to deeply study the rules of SeaFall.

Worse still, my two raids left me adding an enmity sticker on two islands. The only silver lining to this whole disaster was that Mike had to place 5 enmity stickers on my province.

I really enjoyed making money, though!

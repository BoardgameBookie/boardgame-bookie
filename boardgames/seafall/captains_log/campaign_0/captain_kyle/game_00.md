# Prologue

## Playbook

A group of 5 friends, including myself, recently finished a Risk Legacy campaign. It was a great experience and a lot of fun. The legacy style of board game is a great fit for our game group, because the serial nature of the gameplay encourages us to put plans in place to meet again after each game night. As an aside, we've tried holding a regular day and time to host a game night, but this proved impossible with this group; someone would inevitably have a schedule conflict and cancel. After Risk Legacy ended we were looking for another legacy game to play and conveniently the mega-hyped SeaFall by Rob Daviau was recently released. Mike, a big fan of 4X games like Civilization, bought SeaFall for the group and our adventure together was set to begin.

The group consisted of myself, Kyle, and four others: Dave, Jeremy, Mike, and Scott.
  * Dave: Dave is an electrical engineer. He likes engine building. He prefers to fly solo unless there is a clear reason to collaborate.
  * Jeremy: Jeremy is an IT manager. He likes base building and optimizing strategy. He isn't afraid to take risks. He is very social and willing to form partnerships to help him reach his goals.
  * Kyle: I am a data scientist. I like engine building, puzzles, and narrative in gameplay. I enjoy high upside, high variance strategies. I love to make deals and negotiate in games.
  * Mike: Mike is a systems engineer. He likes 4X games. He is a willing collaborator and shrewd planner.
  * Scott: Scott is a software developer. He likes ameritrash games. He plays to the beat of his own drum, actually plays the drums, and will pursue unconventional paths to success.

Heading into the prologue I had no plan. I had lightly skimmed the rule book, but expected to learn the rules by playing the prologue.

## Play-by-play

I ended up winning the prologue, but there was no benefit. In fact, it felt like a slight penalty, because I had to start last during the first game.

The biggest lesson learned, I think for everyone, was the value of exploration. I won primarily, because I spent every turn exploring. It seemed clear that the Explorer's Guild gave the highest expected glory per action.

Gameplay aside, it was a surprise when we had to destroy the leaders we chose to start the prologue, and funny, too, because as a result of the twist, as a group of five men, we are now entirely led by women avatars.

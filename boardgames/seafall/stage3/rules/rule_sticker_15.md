# Relics and Tablets
Relics and tablets are retrieved from tombs and carry over from game to game. Tablets are stored in a province's treasure room and relics are carried on ships, taking up a hold space.

If a found relic cannot be put on a ship when found *(due to damaged holds)* or the ship is sunk carrying a relic, write **LOST** on that relic and return it to the storage chest.

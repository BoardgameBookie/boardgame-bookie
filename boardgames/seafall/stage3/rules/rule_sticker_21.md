# Conquering a Colony (ship present)
Take a raid action against the colony's defense. If you take no damage, take the card and any structures and goods on it. Place enmity tokens equal to its Defense on its Defense Number to show it can't be conquered again this year. These enmity tokens move to the colony's former owner's At War With section in winter, or at the end of the game.

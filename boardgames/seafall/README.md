SeaFall is an epic legacy game created by Rob Daviau and released in 2016. Rolling dice is an essential part of gameplay, and any endeavor attempted in the game carries some risk. Ultimately, it is up to you to weigh the risk, play conservatively or go for glory, but knowing the odds and being an informed player provides a strategic edge. The contents of this project include calculations for dice rolling outcomes across a variety of game situations, and there are a few tables and visual aids that I found useful when playing SeaFall. I've also kept a captain's log that details my plans going into each game and a record of my play-through. Thinking about the numbers between games was one of the best parts of SeaFall for me.

There are six treasure chests in SeaFall that will be opened as the game progresses. It is incredibly exciting whenever a treasure chest is opened, and one of the main draws I have found in legacy games are these moments when something new is brought into the game. Within the chests could be new rules, stickers, cards, or really anything, but regardless of the specific contents the consequences of opening a chest mean players must adapt their strategies on the fly, rapidly synthesize new information, and evaluate how every decision leading up this point now has additional meaning.

However, while there is a thrill in revealing the unknown, this also means legacy games are subject to spoilers. Spoilers for SeaFall, and boardgames in general, is devastating. Knowing something too early would affect strategizing and provide an unfair advantage; it just takes the fun out of the game. Also, this makes reviewing a legacy game particularly hard; reviewers want to discuss the game without spoiling it for their audience, but this can lead to vague commentary on the game.

An even greater challenge than giving a spoiler-free review for SeaFall is writing a spoiler-free rule book that is lucid, yet doesn't prematurely give away a surprise. Unfortunately, the SeaFall rule book does not always provide crystal clear explanations of mechanics. In an effort to be clear and avoid presenting information that would be considered a spoiler the project has been divided up into different *stages* that reflect how many treasure chests have been opened in the game. Without official names for each of the treasure chests, I've decided on the following naming scheme:

Treasure Chest Name | Stage | Image
--- | :---: | ---
starter | 1 | **placeholder**
rough seas | 2 | **placeholder**
ruins | 3 | **placeholder**
cities | 4 | **placeholder**
octopus | 5 | **placeholder**
cryptic eye | 6 | **placeholder**
tsunami | 7 | **placeholder**

# Exploring the Sea
You may take an explore action to try to find an island in an empty sea space in a column without an island. The defense is the number at the column's end. If you succeed, you have found an island in that space. Gain glory for the endeavor as normal. Take a random island card from the storage chest. Read its entry in the Captain's Booke. Follow its instructions.

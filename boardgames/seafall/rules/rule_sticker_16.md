You may raid another player's ship in the same space as your ships. A ship is not a dangerous site. The defender picks the flagship. The defending ship's hold is the defense. Its sail or raid is the garrison *(defender's choice)*. Support ships add or remove a die from the raid pool as normal. Add 1 die to the raid pool if the attacker controls the space. Remove 1 die if the defender controls it.

*Red is raiding green's ships, which are in red's home harbor. Red has a raid pool of 7. Green's defending ship has a hold of two and a sail of three. Red removes three dice due to the "garrison" of the ship. Red must beat a defense of two to not take damage. Green also has an enmity of red, so another die is removed. It's in red's harbor, so a die is added. Both have support ships, which cancel each other.*

## 7. Activate Colonies
Starting with the astrolabe holder and going clockwise, players may activate colonies they control. The cost is 6 gold for each colony you activate. When activating a colony, place a province marker on that colony's island on the game board. The colony is now active. Adjust your glory marker to reflect the glory printed on the colony card.

## 8. Colonies Collect
For each active colony, its Governor may take a good from a site on the island and place it in the colony's warehouse *OR* gain 3 gold if the island has a mine.

# Colonies and Governors
A colony is a separate region on an island and has its own garrison, defense, and sites. The colony card holder is the governor and gets the ability of the colony when it is active. The governor controls the sea space where the colony is located. If you raid an island where you are governor, place an extra enmity token on the raided site.

With the Woodsman as my advisor I would have 4 dice to roll where I needed three successes to avoid damage to my ship. I cast my dice and recoiled once they settled on 3 misses and merely 1 success. I felt this had to have been some rather unlucky outcome. Was I cursed?"

Unfortunately, my ships were both at sea, so my home port was undefended. Mike took advantage and attacked! He had 6 dice to roll and needed 5 successes to raid my treasure room.

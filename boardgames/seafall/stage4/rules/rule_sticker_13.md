# Exploring a Tomb
You may explore an open tomb site. When you do, pick an entry from the tomb map inside the back cover of the Captain's Booke and read the corresponding entry. The defense of the tomb is shown on the tomb sticker. Tombs may occasionally require other ship values instead of explore and always allow for a second way to add dice to your endeavor. The tombs map provides hints to what may be needed. Be prepared. When you explore an entry without taking any damage, that entry will get crossed off and cannot be explored further. Some successful tomb explorations will permanently close a tomb site. A closed tomb site may not be explored at all and a new tomb must be found.

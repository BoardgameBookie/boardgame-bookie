# Treasure Maps
The research maps that contain half of an image are special treasure maps. They may be used as normal research cards, using the power on the card. But, if you have both halves of the same map *(they have the same title)*, go to the location directed on the maps and use an explore action, then read the corresponding entry in the Captain's Booke.

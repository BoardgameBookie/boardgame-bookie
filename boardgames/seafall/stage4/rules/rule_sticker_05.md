# Currents
If you move into a space with a current, you may sail out of the space in the direction the current is pointing without spending a point of movement. You do not have to move with the current and moving in any other direction incurs no extra cost.

# Atolls
Atolls are regions where ships can rearrange their holds and not be in uncharted waters.

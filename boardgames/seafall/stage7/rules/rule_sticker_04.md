# Dangerous Waters
If you move into a space with Dangerous Waters, attempt a SAIL endeavor against the defense of the space. If you don't sink as a result of this endeavor you may continue moving. If your ships sailed together into the space, you only have to pass the Dangerous Waters check once, using the other ship as a support ship. You do not gain glory for passing a Dangerous Waters check.

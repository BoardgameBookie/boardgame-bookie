# Build a Colony (ship present)
Take a Build action while at an island without a colony. Spend six goods, which must include at least one of each type. Goods spent must be on your ships at the island. Choose any colony card from the storage chest. Name your colony. Write the same name on the island's inset box on the game board. Gain three glory. Colonies may be built active *(most of the time)* or inactive *(in the case that you have no more province markers)*. An active colony is worth one glory *(in addition to the three for building it)*. Place one of your province markers *(the back of an enmity token)* on the island space on the board to show ownership of an active colony.

# SeaFall FAQ

An enjoyable SeaFall experience requires a clear understanding of the rules. There is nuance to many of the SeaFall rules and this FAQ is meant to either give further definition to existing rules or explain uncommon situations. Since SeaFall is a legacy game this FAQ has been organized in a manner to prevent unwanted *SPOILERS*. Each box to be opened within SeaFall has its own FAQ section. Some questions are relevant to multiple boxes, so there is redundant information within the FAQ by design. Therefore, check the Prologue section first, and then the FAQ section relevant to a given box to get the most out of the FAQ.

# Prologue/Game 1/Stage I

1.  
  *Q:*  How is the endeavor pool determined for a raid on a province? Do enmity stickers from the attacker and defender both figure into the final dice number?

  *A:*  There are three sources of enmity to consider when provinces are engaged in battle: *At War With*, permanent-province, and regional. *At War With* enmity is found in the *At War With* section of the province board. Permanent-province enmity are the stickers placed at the province region near the home harbor for each player. Regional enmity is any enmity in the region that the raid is taking place. If the raid takes place in the home harbor, then any enmity at province sites also factor into the endeavor. If the raid takes place at an island then any permanent enmity at the island or enmity on island sites will apply. A tweet from Rob Daviau sums up these rules, *"in general, enmity protects you no matter where it is."*

  *At War With* is applied as both an attacker and defender, whereas province enmity is only applied as a defender. The concept of a province is broader than just a region. Attacking anything owned by a province will bring province enmity into the equation. Therefore province enmity will be applied to raid endeavors on their home region, harbors, ships, colonies, and other spaces under a control by a province. *Note: sometimes province is used to refer to the home region or harbor and the province sites in this region. Other times province refers to the player and everything under the control of the player. Therefore, look out for contextual clues to decipher the correct scope of the word, province.*

  *Q:* How does the enmity checkbox on the Province board work?

  *A:* If you have been awarded an enmity upgrade indicated by a marked checkbox, then at the end of the game when determining the lasting enmity on the board, the player with this upgrade gets 1 success for each marked checkbox. For example, if the player has two reputation tokens at the end of the game and 1 enmity checkbox, then that player will have 1-3 successes to remove enmity based on the outcome of the rolling 2 dice. The checkbox counts as a successful roll, so it cannot remove an enmity sticker on its own.

  *Q:* Is glory gained by completing a skill check presented within the Captain's Booke?

  *A:* No, a skill check in the Captain's Booke does not give glory; it is similar to a skill check in dangerous waters where SAIL is used to determine the dice pool. Rather, a glory is gained by the explore endeavor that led to the use of the Captain's Booke and any additional glory gained is explicitly stated in the corresponding passages within the Captain's Booke. Sometimes the skill check uses RAID or EXPLORE, yet while this skill check resembles an endeavor it is only used to resolve the outcome of a passage.

1.  
  *Q:* Is there a maximum size to a dice pool?

  *A:* No. Despite there only being 15 dice provided by the game a dice pool can exceed this number. Therefore, record the results of the first 15 dice and re-roll the number necessary to reach the size of the dice pool. Often large dice pools result from explore endeavors after playing an advisor in combination with research cards among other modifiers.

1.  
  *Q:* If a roll for an endeavor results in all dice being blank, can fortune be used to avoid failure? The wording in the rulebook suggests that rolling all blanks might lead to immediate failure.

  *A:* Yes, fortune can be applied immediately before evaluating the roll. Therefore, disaster can be averted by applying fortune to an all blank roll.

1.
  *Q:* Where do cards go after they are dismissed?

  *A:* After a card is dismissed, it is returned to the bottom of its respective deck. This is particularly important for the advisor deck when using the Guild Hall structure. The advisor deck should never become depleted, because the advisors dismissed from the forum are then immediately placed at the bottom of the deck.

# Attacking Ships

1.  
  *Q:* How are the starting game bonuses for titles calculated?

  *A:* Essentially, perform the division and then perform the "ceiling" operation, i.e. round up to the nearest integer. For example, if a player A is 1 glory behind the leading player B, then player A calculates the bonus threshold 1/5, or 0.2, and rounds up to 1. If player A was 6 glory behind their bonus would be 6/5, or 1.2, and rounds up to 2.

1.  
  *Q:* If a ship sinks while raiding another ship, does the defending ship still take damage?

  *A:* No. When a ship sinks during an endeavor, the endeavor fails and the attacking player's turn ends immediately. Damaging, or plundering, the defender's ship happens only after the attacker successfully completes the raid endeavor. Therefore, the defender's ship escapes unscathed.

1.  
  *Q:* Do Gun Towers participate in ship raids? For example, would Gun Towers protect ships moored in the home harbor?

  *A:* Yes, Gun Towers add one to the garrison in the region where the structure is built to *any* raid. Ship raids differ from land raids in that the base value of garrison is derived from RAID or SAIL, but any garrison modifiers in the region still apply.

1.  
  *Q:* Is attacking a ship also attacking a province?

  *A:* Yes, attacking a ship is also attacking a province. Therefore, province enmity will be applied to the raid endeavor pool.

# Relics and Curses

1.  
  *Q:* Do curse cards stay with a ship after it sinks?

  *A:* No. When a ship sinks everything attached to that ship is lost, including curses. Everything is lost: everything in the hold such as goods and relics, ship upgrades, and damage cards, which include curses. When a ship is rebuilt it does not inherit anything from the previous iteration of the ship, except it retains its game end upgrades; game end upgrades can be thought of as a blueprint or advances in engineering within the province.

1.  
  *Q:* When attempting an endeavor and all blanks are rolled, do successes added from a temple or relic still apply?

  *A:* No, at least one rolled success is required to apply added successes from temples, relics, or other powers.

# Research

1.  
  *Q:* Does the leader upgrade that reads "Research (2 cards)" grant that player 2 research cards, instead of one, for the research action?

  *A:* No, the leader upgrade does not grant a second card.  The "Research (2 cards)" sticker merely behaves like the advisors *Research +X* ability, so the research action is still only for one card. There situation where extra cards are drawn will be clearly stated such as on the *blank* advisor, "".

1.  
  *Q:* Can research cards be stolen during a raid on a province?

  *A:* Yes. Research cards are stored face up in the treasure room of a province. Research cards can be stolen the same way as a treasure card after a successful raid of the treasure room.

1.  
  *Q:* When attempting an endeavor and all blanks are rolled, do successes added from a research card, such as *chart*, apply?

  *A:* No, at least one rolled success is required to apply a chart or other research cards.

  *Q:* Does the leader upgrade that reads "Research (2 cards)" grant that player 2 research cards, instead of one, for the research action?

  *A:* No, the leader upgrade does not grant a second card. The research action is always only for one card. The "Research (2 cards)" sticker merely behaves like the advisors *Research +X* ability.

  *Q:*  How is the endeavor pool determined for a raid on a province? Do enmity stickers from the attacker and defender both figure into the final dice number?

  *A:*  There are two sources of enmity to consider when provinces are engaged in combat: *At War With* and permanent. *At War With* is applied as both an attacker and defender, whereas permanent is only applied as a defender. The concept of a province is broader than just a region. Attacking anything owned by a province will bring province enmity into the equation. Therefore province enmity will be applied to raid endeavors on their home region, harbors, ships, colonies, and other spaces under a control by a province. *Note: sometimes province is used to refer to the home region or harbor and the province sites in this region. Other times province refers to the player and everything under the control of the player. Therefore, look out for contextual clues to decipher the correct scope of the word, province.*

  *Q:* Is attacking a ship also attacking a province?

  *Q:* Is glory gained by completing a skill check presented within the Captain's Booke?

  *A:* No, a skill check in the Captain's Booke does not give glory; it is similar to a skill check in dangerous waters where SAIL is used to determine the dice pool. Rather, a glory is gained by the explore endeavor that led to the use of the Captain's Booke and any additional glory gained is explicitly stated in corresponding passages within the Captain's Booke. Sometimes the skill used is RAID or EXPLORE, and while this skill check resembles an endeavor it is only used to resolve the outcome of a passage.

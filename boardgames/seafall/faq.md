  *Q:* Does the leader upgrade that reads "Research (2 cards)" grant that player 2 research cards, instead of one, for the research action?

  *A:* No, the leader upgrade does not grant a second card.  The "Research (2 cards)" sticker merely behaves like the advisors *Research +X* ability, so the research action is still only for one card.

  *Q:*  How is the endeavor pool determined for a raid on a province? Do enmity stickers from the attacker and defender both figure into the final dice number?

  *A:*  There are three sources of enmity to consider when provinces are engaged in battle: *At War With*, permanent-province, and regional. *At War With* enmity is found in the *At War With* section of the province board. Permanent-province enmity are the stickers placed at the province region near the home harbor for each player. Regional enmity is any enmity in the region that the raid is taking place. If the raid takes place in the home harbor, then any enmity at province sites also factor into the endeavor. If the raid takes place at an island then any permanent enmity at the island or enmity on island sites will apply. A tweet from Rob Daviau sums up these rules, *"in general, enmity protects you no matter where it is."*

  *At War With* is applied as both an attacker and defender, whereas permanent-province is only applied as a defender. The concept of a province is broader than just a region. Attacking anything owned by a province will bring province enmity into the equation. Therefore province enmity will be applied to raid endeavors on their home region, harbors, ships, colonies, and other spaces under a control by a province. *Note: sometimes province is used to refer to the home region or harbor and the province sites in this region. Other times province refers to the player and everything under the control of the player. Therefore, look out for contextual clues to decipher the correct scope of the word, province.*

  *Q:* Is attacking a ship also attacking a province?

  *A:* Yes, attacking a ship is also attacking a province. Therefore, province enmity will be applied to the raid endeavor pool.

  *Q:* Is glory gained by completing a skill check presented within the Captain's Booke?

  *A:* No, a skill check in the Captain's Booke does not give glory; it is similar to a skill check in dangerous waters where SAIL is used to determine the dice pool. Rather, a glory is gained by the explore endeavor that led to the use of the Captain's Booke and any additional glory gained is explicitly stated in the corresponding passages within the Captain's Booke. Sometimes the skill check uses RAID or EXPLORE, yet while this skill check resembles an endeavor it is only used to resolve the outcome of a passage.

  *Q:* Do Gun Towers participate in ship raids? For example, would Gun Towers protect ships moored in the home harbor?

  *A:* Yes, Gun Towers add one to the garrison in the region where the structure is built to *any* raid. Ship raids differ from land raids in that the base value of garrison is derived from RAID or SAIL, but any garrison modifiers in the region still apply.

# Raid a Colony (ship present)
When raiding a colony, use the colony's defense and garrison, not the island's garrison. Use the governor's enmity, not the island's. You cannot raid sites on an inactive colony.

Raids against an island with a colony still use the island garrison and enmity but the governor's ships may now act as defending support ships.

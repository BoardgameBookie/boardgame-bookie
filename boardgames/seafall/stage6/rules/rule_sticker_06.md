# Portals of the Ancients
After sailing into this space, if you survive the Dangerous Waters check, you may immediately move to any other space containing a Portal of the Ancients. Doing this does not require a point of movement. You may continue moving if you have points of movement left. Do not do a Dangerous Waters check for the Portal you arrive at.

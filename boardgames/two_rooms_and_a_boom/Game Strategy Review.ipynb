    "With zero information, yes, the President is more likely than not to survive, though this bias is reduced as the player count increases. To show this is true the a game of Two Rooms and a Boom, no matter how many rounds, can be simplified to the process of assigning roles at the beginning of the game when no information is collected between the players. *Note, this sounds like a boring way to play the game, with no color sharing or card sharing. However, adding Yog-Sothoth to the mix can create an environment where everyone is relectant to speak.*"

However, despite the scenario seemingly being left to chance, tension in the game remains. The difference in the outcome would come during the hostage negotation when on one leader can reading the other leader's poker face or psyching-out the other leader."

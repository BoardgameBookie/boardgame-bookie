 A third consecutive loss! This game has us rattled. We want to avoid losing a forth and being forced to open the "we are terrible at this game" box. Despite the frustration of losing a 3rd game in a row, this time we were able to make a positive impact on the board. After losing March we were forced to add the South America sticker to the board. This gave us a new place to explore. The cost it seems, in addition to hurting our final score, is that we don't get an unrationed event card that is powerful and pads the deck. To salve our disappoint, and in a long awaited moment of excitement, we discovered a new Haven in the Pacific ocean! The discovery led to us opening a game box and a couple other doors, including a game-changing sticker that gives us 15 supply cubes from the reserve at the beginning of the game.

 For the next game, we've got more supplies, it feels like, than ever before. Also, we'll get to choose 6 rationed event cards, which will certainly help out. Going into the next game I feel confident in our ability to win. Finally, the deck is stacked in our favor.
